In 2018, Alaska Airlines introduced its basic economy “Saver Fare”. A Saver Fare costs about $30-$40 less than an economy ticket but has limited amenities, including no flight changes, being last to board, and assigned or limited seats. Alaska is responding, it appears, to the increased competitive threat of low-cost carriers such as Spirit Airlines and is following similar moves by Delta, United, and other traditional airlines.

Do you believe Alaska’s introduction of the Saver Fare was a good strategic move? That is, will it (1) attract customers who might normally fly on low-cost carriers and (2) improve Alaska’s profitability? Why or why not?
