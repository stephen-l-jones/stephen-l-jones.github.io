COSTCO IS the third largest retailer in the world. The company pioneered the membership club model, offering bulk quantities at deeply discounted prices. Founded in 1983 in Seattle, Washington, the company has grown to over 900 warehouses serving 145mn cardholders worldwide. Despite operating on frighteningly thin margins, Costco has consistently delivered impressive results, growing its revenue and profit each year. It also maintains a reputation for customer loyalty and employee satisfaction. Yet Costco’s approach seems counterintuitive: it caps markups, pays workers well above industry standards, and limits product selection to roughly 4,000 SKUs compared to tens of thousands at traditional retailers. How has Costco achieved such remarkable success while seemingly defying conventional retail wisdom?

Profitability analysis can help answer that question.

Profitability analysis reveals when strategies are working and why. It also suggests how to improve faltering strategies. The insights come from digging into a firms’ financial statements, uncovering the effects of their business decisions. 

The goal of profitability analysis is different from other kinds of financial statement analysis. For example, an investment banker analyzes a company’s financial statements to estimate a its worth⁠—or *enterprise value*⁠—often in preparation for an acquisition. An investor does similar analysis to buy or sell stocks. A strategist, in contrast, analyzes a firm’s profitability to improve its performance. The strategist’s aim is to increase the firm’s value, not just calculate it.

This article explains how to analyze profitability. It details important profitability ratios and explains how to calculate them and link them to strategic decisions. 

## Profitability as return on invested capital
Return on invested capital (ROIC) succinctly expresses a firm’s financial performance. It measures how well a firm transforms an input⁠—in this case, invested capital⁠—into profit. For example, a 20% ROIC means that for every dollar invested, a firm generates 20 cents of profit from its operations. 

ROIC is part of a family of profitability measures, which includes return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA). But this article only uses ROIC to measure profitability. Theoretically, it captures a firm’s profit-generating efficiency better than any other measure.

ROIC focuses on a firm’s operating decisions. Operating decisions relate to the core activities of the firm, such as manufacturing, marketing, and management. They constrast from financing decisions, which deal with questions like where to stash extra cash and whether to use debt or equity to raise capital. By exclusively focusing on operating decisions, ROIC can express profitability without worrying about how a firm is funded.

### Calculating return on invested capital (ROIC)
ROIC is calculated using a firm’s income statements and balance sheets. It is a non-standard measure, so it requires some judgment. (I’ll present a common method to calculate ROIC, but it’s not the only one.) The calculation is complicated by the fact that financial statements reflect both operating decisions and financing decisions, and ROIC requires that the two be teased apart. To get to just the operating decisions, the ROIC calculation excludes or adjusts financial statement numbers affected by financing decisions.

ROIC is a ratio of *net operating profit after tax* (NOPAT) over average *invested capital* (IC). NOPAT measures profit generated by operating decisions. IC measures the debt and equity employed by a firm. The ROIC formula for a given year `t` is:  
```
\text{ROIC}_t = \frac{\text{NOPAT}_t}{\text{average IC}_t} = \frac{\text{NOPAT}_t}{(\text{IC}_t + \text{IC}_{t-1})/2}
```
For example, Costco’s NOPAT in fiscal year (FY) 2025 was $7.8bn, and its IC at the end of FY 2025 and 2024 was $36.1bn and $33.8bn, respectively. So Costco’s ROIC for FY 2025 was:
```
\begin{aligned}
  \text{Costco ROIC}_{2025} &= \frac{\text{NOPAT}_{2025}}{(\text{IC}_{2025} + \text{IC}_{2024})/2} \\
                            &= \frac{\$7.8\text{bn}}{(\$36.1\text{bn} + \$33.8\text{bn})/2} \\
                            &= \frac{\$7.8\text{bn}}{\$35.0\text{bn}} \\
                            &= 22.3\%
\end{aligned}
```
For every dollar invested, Costco generated 22.3 cents in profit from its operations.

**Net operating profit after tax (NOPAT).** NOPAT is the ROIC numerator and is calculated using income statement items. (Items are written ``monospace underlined`` when introduced.) The NOPAT formula for year `t` is:
```
\text{NOPAT}_t = \text{operating profit}_t-\text{adjusted taxes}_t
```
*Operating profit* is often labeled ``operating income`` or ``earnings before interest and taxes`` (EBIT) on an income statement.[^1] It excludes profit and loss items related to financing decisions, such as ``interest expense`` or ``non-operating income and expenses``.

Operating profit excludes income taxes, but taxes reflect operating decisions and need to be accounted for. However, there is an issue with simply subtracting taxes from operating profit. In the United States, companies’ taxes fall when they acquire debt (because interest is deducted from taxable income). This means financing decisions affect taxes: firms financed with debt lower their tax bill.[^2] To account for this, NOPAT uses *adjusted taxes*, which is calculated using a firm’s effective tax rate.[^3] Adjusted taxes for year `t` is:
```
\begin{aligned}
  \text{adjusted taxes}_t &= \text{operating profit}_t\times\text{effective tax rate}_t \\ 
                          &= \text{operating profit}_t\times\frac{\text{provision for taxes}_t}{\text{earnings before taxes}_t}  
\end{aligned}
```
Both ``provision for taxes`` and ``earnings before taxes`` (not to be confused with EBIT) are income statement items. And the NOPAT formula for year `t` can be rewritten using only income statement items as:
```
\begin{aligned}
  \text{NOPAT}_t &= \text{operating profit}_t-\text{adjusted taxes}_t \\
                 &= \text{operating profit}_t-\text{operating profit}_t\times\frac{\text{provision for taxes}_t}{\text{earnings before taxes}_t} \\
                 &= \text{operating profit}_t\times\left(1-\frac{\text{provision for taxes}_t}{\text{earnings before taxes}_t}\right)        
\end{aligned}
```
Costco’s NOPAT in FY 2025 was already mentioned: $7.8bn. It was calculated using Costco’s 2025 income statement:
```
\begin{aligned}
  \text{Costco  NOPAT}_{2025} &= \text{operating profit}_{2025}\times\left(1-\frac{\text{provision for taxes}_{2025}}{\text{earnings before taxes}_{2025}}\right) \\ 
                              &= \$10.4\text{bn}\times\left(1-\frac{\$2.7\text{bn}}{\$10.8\text{bn}}\right) \\
                              &= \$10.4\text{bn}\times\left(1-0.25\right) \\
                              &= \$7.8\text{bn}
\end{aligned}
```
This shows that Costco’s effective tax rate was 25%.

**Invested capital (IC).** IC is the ROIC denominator and is calculated using balance sheet items, starting with ``total assets``. The IC formula at the end of year `t` is:[^4] 
```
\text{IC}_t = \text{total assets}_t-\text{NIBCLs}_t-\text{excess cash}_t
```
NIBCLs stands for *non-interest-bearing current liabilities*. They are current liabilities (due within one year) that have no implied or express rate of return. (In contrast, interest-bearing current liabilities earn a return. For example, the ``current portion of long-term debt`` earns interest.) NIBCLs include items such as ``accounts payable``, ``taxes payable``, ``unearned revenue``, ``accrued wages payable``, and other accrued liabilities. They represent capital belonging to suppliers, governments, customers, or employees briefly held by the firm. 

NIBCLs can constitute a large portion of a firm’s capital base. Costco’s NIBCLs were $36.7bn in 2025, constituting 48% of its total assets. Of that, $27.7bn was accounts payable owed to suppliers. But suppliers are not Costco investors; they don’t earn a return by letting Costco hold money owed to them. Thus, accounts payable and other NIBCLs aren’t considered “invested” capital and are subtracted from total assets in the IC formula.

*Excess cash* is cash that is not employed in a firm’s operations. For example, at the end of FY 2025, Apple held $132bn of ``cash`` and [``marketable securities``](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketablesecurities.asp) (which are liquid like cash). But Apple uses only a small fraction of it in its day-to-day operations. Most of the cash sits in accounts earning a return. Since the excess cash is not actually employed in a firm’s operations, it is subtracted from total assets in the IC formula.

While conceptually clear, excess cash is difficult to quantify because it’s not found on the balance sheet. A firm normally needs cash [equal to 2% to 5% of annual sales](https://www.shareholderforum.com/returns/Library/20140604_Mauboussin-Callahan.pdf) to run its daily operations. A stable firm in a stable industry might only need cash equal to 2% of sales. Cash held beyond that would be excess.[^5] A growing firm in a volatile industry might need cash equal to 5% of sales (or more).

At the end of FY 2025, Costco held $15.3bn in cash and short-term investments, and 2025 sales were $275.2bn. Assuming Costco needed cash equal to 4% of sales, its 2025 cash need was $275.2bn × 0.04 = $11.0bn. Thus, Costco held $15.3bn − $11.0bn = $4.3bn in excess cash.[^6] At the end of the prior fiscal year, Costco had $1.0bn in excess cash. Costco’s average IC in 2025 was:

|  Costco (in billions) |    2025   |    2024   | Average   |
|:----------------------|----------:|----------:|----------:|
|  Total assets         |   $77.1   |   $69.8   |   $73.5   |
|  Less: NIBCLs         |   $36.7   |   $35.0   |   $35.9   |
|  Less: Excess cash    |    $4.3   |    $1.0   |    $2.7   |
| **Invested capital**  | **$36.1** | **$33.8** | **$35.0** |

These IC numbers were used to calculate Costco’s ROIC above.

**Another view of invested capital.** Total assets can be separated into three kinds of assets: (1) current assets, (2) property, plant, and equipment (PPE), and (3) other assets. Current assets is the ``total current assets`` balance sheet item. PPE is the ``net property, plant, and equipment`` balance sheet item.[^7] And other assets includes all other long-term assets on the balance sheet, such as ``goodwill`` and ``intangible assets``.

Current assets is used to calculate a firm’s net working capital (NWC). For the purposes of profitability analysis, NWC at the end of year `t` is:
```
\text{NWC}_t = \text{current assets}_t-\text{NIBCLs}_t-\text{excess cash}_t
```
This is a non-standard formula for NWC. (Usually it’s calculated as current assets less current liabilities.) But we use this formulation because it answers the question, “How much invested capital is needed to run the firm’s day-to-day operations?”. A lower NWC suggests that a firm can operate primarily on the “free” financing NIBCLs provide. Indeed, a negative NWC benefits a firm: it indicates that the firm’s NIBCLs fully meet its short-term capital needs, with some free financing to spare. 

Costco had current assets of $38.4bn and $34.3bn at the end of FY 2025 and 2024, respectively, so its NWC was:
```
\begin{aligned}
  \text{Costco NWC}_{2025} &= \$38.4\text{bn}-\$36.7\text{bn}-\$4.3\text{bn} = \text{−\$2.6bn} \\
  \text{Costco NWC}_{2024} &= \$34.3\text{bn}-\$35.0\text{bn}-\$1.0\text{bn} = \text{−\$1.7bn}
\end{aligned}
```
Costco sells its goods before suppliers’ invoices become due. And it collects annual membership fees (as unearned revenue) when members join or renew. In this way, Costco’s suppliers and members finance Costco’s day-to-day operations interest free.

Starting with NWC instead of ``total assets``, the IC at the end of year `t` is calculated as:
```
\text{IC}_t = \text{NWC}_t+\text{PPE}_t+\text{other assets}_t
```
We can use this alternate formula to again calculate Costco’s average IC for FY 2025:

|  Costco (in billions)            |    2025   |    2024   | Average   |
|:---------------------------------|----------:|----------:|----------:|
|  Net working capital             |   −$2.6   |   −$1.7   |   −$2.1   |
|  Net PPE + operating leases[^7]  |   $34.6   |   $31.6   |   $33.1   |
|  Other assets                    |    $4.1   |    $3.9   |    $4.0   |
| **Invested capital**             | **$36.1** | **$33.8** | **$35.0** |


Figure 1 presents the ROIC ratio and many other ratios associated with it. (I’ll refer to this figure throughout the article.) 

![Figure 1 Profitability analysis ratios](../img/profitability-ratios.png#small)


### ROIC Benchmarks
In FY 2020, Costco’s ROIC was 17.4%, but does that mean Costco was highly profitable or doing poorly? To know, we need to compare Costco’s ROIC to a meaningful benchmark. Three common benchmarks are:

1. A competitor’s ROIC
2. A firm’s historical ROIC
3. The average ROIC in a firm’s industry

Walmart is a good competitor benchmark for Costco. They’re in the same industry and both are regarded as excellent grocery and general retailers. Walmart’s ROIC for its year ending January 31, 2020, was 9.5%. That means Costco returned 7.9 cents more than Walmart for every dollar invested, suggesting that Costco is highly profitable. 

Figure 2 shows Costco’s and Walmart’s ROIC over time. Benchmarking Costco’s historical performance, we find that Costco improved its profitability over time. In 2012, Costco’s ROIC was 11.4%, so it improved its profitability by 6 cents per dollar invested in nine years. In contrast, Walmart’s ROIC has trended downward over the same time period.

![Figure 2. Costco v. Walmart](../img/costco-v-walmart.png)

Additionally, Costco’s ROIC was much better than the industry average ROIC. Costco is a grocery and general merchandise retailer ([NAICS code 452311](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?code=452311&search=2017%20NAICS%20Search)). According to [Aswath Damodaran of New York University](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/mgnroc.html), the industry average ROIC for grocery retail was 7.1% and general retail was 13.8% in the U.S. in 2020, which puts Costco above the averages. Overall, Costco’s performance was better than Walmart’s, it increased over the prior nine years, and it was much better than the industry averages. All of these comparisons show that Costco is a superior performer.

### ROIC and economic value creation
A positive ROIC does not necessarily mean that a firm is creating economic value. This is because investors expect a return on their investments, which represent financial costs to a firm, but these costs do not appear in the ROIC calculation. Costs to access capital are associated with financing decisions which, by design, are excluded from ROIC. For a firm to create economic value, its ROIC must be greater than its cost of capital.[^8] For example, Costco created economic value in 2020 because its ROIC was higher than its cost of capital, which was 4.2% [according to Guru Focus](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/wacc/NAS:COST/WACC-/Costco-Wholesale). 

In contrast, Skullcandy, a [maker of headphones and rooted in extreme sports](https://www.skullcandy.com/inside-skullcandy), did not create economic value before it was [taken private by Mill Road Capital](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/10/03/876636/0/en/Skullcandy-Closes-Going-Private-Transaction-with-Mill-Road-Capital.html) in 2016. Skullcandy’s cost of capital was 7.2% in FY 2015 but its ROIC was only 4.6%, which was 2.6% lower than its cost of capital. Thus, while Skullcandy’s operations were profitable, it actually destroyed economic value because it did not generate sufficient profits to meet its cost of capital.

## Going deeper: Return on sales and capital turnover
A firm’s ROIC will tell you how profitable the firm is, but it won’t tell you why. It’s only the starting point for understanding how a firm’s strategies are affecting its profitability. The next step is to calculate a firm’s return on sales and capital turnover, as shown in Figure 1. These two ratios give different views into why a firm is profitable or not.

### Return on sales
Return on sales measures of a firm’s operating efficiency. It’s the percentage of revenues that, after subtracting expenses related to operations, become profit. It’s an operating efficiency measure because a firm’s return on sales is higher when the firm is able to control or lower its operating costs. 

The formula for return on sales in year `t` is:
```
return\ on\ sales_t = \frac{NOPAT_t}{sales_t}
```
Return on sales uses the same numerator as ROIC, but instead of dividing NOPAT by invested capital, NOPAT is divided by ``sales`` or ``revenues``. For example, recall that Costco’s NOPAT in FY 2020 was $4.11 billion on revenues of $166.76 billion. So its return on sales was $4.11 ÷ $166.76 = 2.5%, which means 2.5% of Costco’s revenues converted to profit.

### Capital turnover
Capital turnover measures a firm’s capital efficiency and is usually expressed as a dollar amount. It’s the amount of revenue generated per dollar of invested capital. A firm that generates more sales than a rival on the same one dollar of invested capital will have a higher capital turnover.

The formula for capital turnover in year `t` is:
```
capital\ turnover_t = \frac{sales_t}{average\ IC_t}
```
Capital turnover uses the same denominator as ROIC, but the numerator is sales instead of NOPAT. For example, recall that Costco’s capital turnover in FY 2020 was $23.69 billion. So its capital turnover was $166.76 ÷ $23.69 = $7.04, which means every dollar of invested capital generated $7.04 in revenue.

### Relationship with return on invested capital
The combination of return on sales and capital turnover has a direct mathematical relationship with ROIC:
```
ROIC_t = return\ on\ sales_t \times capital\ turnover_t
```
Expanding the return on sales and capital turnover ratios shows why this relationship holds. Multiplying the two produces the original ROIC calculation:
```
ROIC_t = \frac{NOPAT_t}{sales_t} \times \frac{sales_t}{average\ IC_t} = \frac{NOPAT_t}{average\ IC_t}
```
This relationship shows that increasing either return on sales or capital turnover will increase return on invested capital. For example, if a firm lowers its material costs to increase its operating efficiency, it will increase its return on sales and ultimately its ROIC. Or if a firm improves the utilization of its manufacturing plants to increase its capital efficiency, it will increase its capital turnover and its ROIC. 

Further, a firm with a negative return on sales will have a negative ROIC. In this case, if the firm increased its capital turnover without improving its return on sales, it would exacerbate its operating inefficiencies and drive its ROIC even more negative. A firm with a negative return on sales must address its operating inefficiencies first.

### Benchmarks
Like ROIC, return on sales and capital turnover can be benchmarked against rivals’ metrics, historical metrics, or industry average metrics. Benchmarking these metrics provides analysts with their first insight into *why* a firm’s ROIC is good or poor. If a firm’s return on sales diverges from the benchmark return on sales, then operating efficiency — and strategies associated with it — help explain a firm’s better or worse profitability. Likewise, if a firm’s capital turnover diverges from the benchmark capital turnover then capital efficiency and capital efficiency strategies explain the profitability differences.

For example, recall that Costco’s ROIC was better than Walmart’s. Costco’s higher profitability could be driven by Costco’s operating efficiency or capital efficiency or both. By comparing return on sales, we find that operating efficiency does not explain Costco’s higher ROIC: Costco’s return on sales in FY 2020 was 2.5%, which was lower than Walmat’s 3.0% return on sales. Instead, capital efficiency explains the difference in profitability: Costco’s capital turnover of $7.04 dwarfed Walmart’s capital turnover of $3.20. 

This analysis allows us to narrow our focus on what’s driving Costco’s success. From here, we can consider Costco’s strategies that allow it to use its capital so efficiently. 

## Going even deeper: Expense, asset, and unit-based ratios
Once analysts have calculated return on sales and capital turnover, they can go even deeper by analyzing why a firm’s operating or capital efficiency is good or poor. To understand the reasons for a firm’s operating efficiency, we can calculate various expense ratios using the income statement (see Figure 1). And to better understand a firm’s capital efficiency, we can calculate asset ratios using the balance sheet. 

While return on sales and capital turnover are applicable to nearly all companies, specific expense and asset ratios are particular to an industry. This is because the nature of expenses and assets differ from one industry to the next. The ratios I show here in the retail sector may be different than the ratios that are useful in, for instance, the airline industry or the high tech sector. Thus, it is important to first understand how an industry uses assets and generates expenses. Then you can calculate the expense and asset ratios that are applicable to your industry. 

### Expense ratios
Expense ratios help explain why a firm’s operating efficiency is good or poor. An expense ratio is calculated by taking an operating expense — such as ``cost of goods sold`` (COGS) or ``selling, general, and administrative`` (SGA) — from the income statement and dividing it by sales. A lower expense ratio indicates greater operating efficiency. In the retail sector, common ratios include “COGS over sales” and “SG&A over sales”.

Like other ratios we’ve calculated, expense ratios can be benchmarked against rivals’ ratios or a firm’s historical performance. For example, Costco’s COGS over sales in FY 2020 was 86.9% compared to Walmart’s 75.3%. Thus, one reason Walmart had better operating efficiency was that its product costs relative to sales was lower. On the other hand, Costco’s SG&A over sales was only 9.8% compared to Walmart’s 20.8%. This shows that Costco was much better at keeping its overhead expenses low.

Expense ratios directly relate to return on sales. If an expense ratio increases, then a firm’s return on sales will decrease, and vice versa. This can be shown by expanding the return on sales formula. First, we can expand NOPAT in the numerator into operating profit less adjusted (adj.) taxes:
```
return\ on\ sales_t = \frac{NOPAT_t}{sales_t} = \frac{operating\ profit_t - adj.\ taxes_t}{sales_t}
```
Then, we can expand operating profit into sales less the income statement’s operating expenses. For the retail sector, we’ll assume that there are only two operating expenses: COGS and SG&A. Thus, the return on sales formula becomes:
```
\frac{operating\ profit_t - adj.\ taxes_t}{sales_t} = \frac{sales_t - COGS_t - SG\&A_t - adj.\ taxes_t}{sales_t}
```
This expression can be further reorganized to show that return on sales in year `t` is:
```
return\ on\ sales_t = 1-\left(\frac{COGS_t}{sales_t}+\frac{SG\&A_t}{sales_t}+\frac{adj.\ taxes_t}{sales_t}\right)
```
For example, Costco’s return on sales in FY 2020 can be expressed as:
```
Costco\ return\ on\ sales_{2020} = 1-(86.9\%+9.8\%+0.8\%) = 2.5\%
```
This formulation of return on sales makes it easier to see that as any expense ratio (such as COGS over sales) increases, return on sales will decrease.

### Asset ratios
Asset ratios explain why a firm’s capital efficiency is good or poor. An asset ratio is calculated by taking an asset item from the balance sheet and dividing it by sales. A lower asset ratio indicates greater capital efficiency. In the retail sector, common ratios include “average NWC over sales” and “average net PPE over sales”. 

Costco’s average NWC over sales in FY 2020 was −1.3% compared to Walmart’s −1.5%. This suggests that Costco’s greater capital efficiency is not due to better working capital management. Walmart had a lower average NWC over sales ratio. But Costco’s average net PPE over sales at 14.4% was lower than Walmart’s at 23.8%. This indicates that Costco is able to use less property to generate each dollar of sales.

Asset ratios decrease capital turnover when the asset ratios increase, similar to how expense ratios affect return on sales. This can be shown by expanding the capital turnover formula. First, capital turnover in year t can be expressed as the inverse of average IC over sales:
```
capital\ turnover_t =  \left(\frac{avg.\ IC_t}{sales_t}\right)^{-1}
```
Recall that average IC can be expressed as the sum of average NWC, average net PPE, and average other assets. Thus, capital turnover can be expressed as:
```
capital\ turnover_t = \left(\frac{avg.\ NWC_t}{sales_t}+\frac{avg.\ net\ PPE_t}{sales_t}+\frac{avg.\ other\ assets_t}{sales_t}\right)^{-1}
```
For example, Costco’s capital turnover in FY 2020 can be expressed as:
```
Costco\ capital\ turnover_{2020} = (−1.3\%+14.4\%+1.2\%)^{-1} = \$7.04
```
If the sum of the ratios increases, then its inverse will decrease (and vice-versa). Thus, lowering the asset ratios increases capital turnover and ultimately ROIC.

### Unit-based ratios
All of the ratios introduced so far have been dollar denominated, meaning they either have sales dollars or invested capital dollars as the denominator. However, insights into profitability, operating efficiency, and capital efficiency can also come from ratios denominated in sales units or asset units. For example, in the airline industry, capital efficiency is often expressed as revenue per available seat mile. It’s calculated by dividing an airline’s total revenue by the total number of miles every seat in every plane flew in a year (regardless of whether there was a passenger in it). Further, airline operating efficiency can be expressed as cost per passenger mile, which is calculated by dividing operating expenses by the total number of miles every passenger was flown in a year. In retail, capital efficiency is often expressed as revenue per store or revenue per square foot. Stores and square feet are important asset units for physical retail. Profitability in retail can also be expressed as NOPAT per store or NOPAT per square foot. 

Unit-based ratios often complement dollar-denominated ratios and add additional insight. But data for unit sales or asset units can be difficult to get, so using them depends on available information. And the types of units that are meaningful will differ among industries. Still, they are useful metrics if you can calculate them.

## Analyzing profitability: Costco vs. Walmart
Figure 1 captures the various ratios we’ve discussed. Profitability analysis normally begins at the top of Figure 1 and works downward, exploring branches where the firm’s ratios diverge from the benchmark’s ratios. When the ratios diverge, it gives analysts the opportunity to reflect on the firm’s or competitor’s strategies to understand why the ratios differ. It also provides strategists opportunities to see whether the firm’s strategies are having the expected effect on performance. For example, if executives enacted a new strategy to improve operating efficiency but operating efficiency hasn’t improved over time, then the firm may need to revisit its strategy.

To illustrate, I’ll analyze Costco’s performance in FY 2020 with Walmart as the competitor benchmark, as shown in Figure 3. My analysis will be brief. Much more could be said beyond what I analyze here, but it will illustrate how you can connect strategy to profitability.

![Figure 3. Profitability analysis: Costco v. Walmart, FY 2020](../img/profitability-costco-v-walmart.png#small)

First, we ask, which firm was more profitable? Based on Figure 3, we answer: Costco. Costco’s ROIC was 17.4% compared to Walmart’s ROIC of 9.5%. The next question is, why? The answer is because Costco’s capital efficiency was better than Walmart’s. Costco’s capital turnover was $7.04 compared to Walmart’s $3.20, meaning Coscto generated $3.84 of revenue more than Walmart for every dollar invested. (In contrast, Costco’s return on sales was lower, suggesting Walmart has higher operating efficiency.)

The next question is, why was Costco’s capital efficiency higher? To answer, we point to Costco’s average net PPE over sales, which was 14.4% compared to Walmart’s 23.8%. (Remember that lower asset ratios indicated better capital efficiency.) We can also highlight Costco’s revenue per square foot of retail space, which was $1,450 per square foot in FY 2020 compared to Walmart’s $464 per square foot. Costco is much better at using its stores to generate revenue.

Next we ask, what strategies has Costco adopted vis-à-vis Walmart that allows its capital to be so efficient? We can point to a couple of strategies. First, Costco sells in bulk quantities, which increases the revenue from each customer visit. Thus, a busy Costco will generate more revenue than a busy Walmart simply based on bulk sales. Second, Costco only sells high-volume merchandise. In contrast, Walmart sells many products to make it a one-stop shop. But that means many of Walmart’s products are lower volume. Thus, Walmart is unable to generate the same level sales using a similar store footprint.

In other words, the difference in capital efficiency points to differences in strategy: Costco’s strategies center on high sales volumes of a few products. Walmart’s strategies center on the convenience of one-stop shopping.

Now that we’ve created a link between strategy and performance — that is, a high-volume strategy leads to higher capital efficiency — we can begin to think about how changes to Costco’s strategies might change performance. For example, if Costco wanted to sell more products to be more convenient, what would happen to its performance? Our analysis suggests that Costco’s capital efficiency would fall (because its new products would have lower volumes relative to its current products) and its profitability would suffer. However, Costco could sell seasonal products (which have lower average volumes) without hurting its capital efficiency if it sold them only during the products’ seasons of high demand. Indeed, Costco uses this strategy to sell camping equipment during the summer and hot chocolate mixes during the winter.

## Summary
Strategists analyze their firm’s profitability to understand how their firm’s strategies lead to superior performance or underperformance. Profitability is measured as return on invested capital (ROIC) and is benchmarked against (1) a competitor’s ROIC, (2) a firm’s historical ROIC, or (3) the average ROIC in a firm’s industry. To understand why a firm is performing well or not, profitability can be separated into operating efficiency and capital efficiency. Operating efficiency is concerned with how to keep costs low so that more of every revenue dollar can convert to profit. In other words, it is focused on minimizing expenses. Capital efficiency is concerned with how much revenue every dollar of invested capital generates. It is focused on asset utilization. Operating and capital efficiency can be further divided into detailed expense ratios and asset ratios that provide greater insight. Unit-based ratios also complement these ratios. Overall, the strategists’ goal is to understand how their firm’s strategies drive profitability.

[^1]. Operating profit is sometimes adjusted before calculating NOPAT. For example, [impairments to long-lived intangible assets](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/what-are-differences-between-amortization-and-impairment.asp) (which are an operating expense) are normally excluded. 

[^2]. Here is an example: Firm A and Firm B both have an operating profit of $100 and a 20% tax rate. Firm A is financed by debt and pays $40 in interest. Firm B is financed by equity and pays no interest. Firm A’s taxable income is $100 − $40 = $60. Firm B’s taxable income is $100. Firm A’s operating profit less taxes is $100 − ($60 ⨉ 0.20) = $88. But Firm B’s is only $100 − ($100 ⨉ 0.20) = $80. 

[^3]. Sometimes the effective tax rate can be problematic. For example, airlines, which have a history of magnificent losses, can apply [net operating loss carryforwards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/losscarryforward.asp), which may create negative effective tax rates and make NOPAT hard to interpret. In such cases, strategists may simply use operating profits (before taxes) or apply a historical average effective tax rate. Whatever adjustment is used should be applied to all benchmarks.

[^4]. Sometimes [``goodwill``](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goodwill.asp) is also subtracted from total assets. Whether to do so depends on how frequently a firm acquires other companies, the nature of the industry, and the purpose of the analysis. If goodwill is subtracted from total assets, it should be done for all firms included in the analysis.

[^5]. The formula is `\text{max}(0,\ \text{cash}_t − \text{sales}_t \times p)`, where `p` is a chosen percentage (e.g., 2%). Alternatively, excess cash can be considered any cash that’s not needed to cover a firm’s current liabilities less non-cash current assets. The alternate formula is `\text{min}(\text{cash}_t,\ \text{max}(0,\ \text{current assets}_t − \text{current liabilities}_t))`.

[^6]. Using the alternative method in footnote 5, Costco’s excess cash in FY 2025 was `\text{min}(\$14.2\text{bn},\ \text{max}(0,\ \$38.4\text{bn}−\$37.1\text{bn})) = \$1.3\text{bn}`.

[^7]. Many firms choose to lease instead of own all of land and buildings they use. These leases are called right-of-use assets and appear separately from net PPE on a balance sheet. They are considered PPE for profitability analysis and should be added to net PPE when calculating IC. 

[^8]. In the case of debt, such as corporate bonds or bank loans, the cost of capital is the coupon or interest rate for the debt. In the case of equity, the cost of capital in the implied rate of return expected by shareholders. A firm’s cost of capital is normally based on its [weighted average cost of capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp).
