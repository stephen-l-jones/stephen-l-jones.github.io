Amazon recently entered the nearly $1 trillion U.S. grocery industry. It has a small but growing online and brick-and-mortar grocery presence through its acquisition of [Whole Foods](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/) and its introduction of [AmazonFresh](https://www.amazon.com/fmc/storefront?almBrandId=QW1hem9uIEZyZXNo), [Prime Now](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/prime-now-finds-a-new-home-on-amazon), and [Amazon Go](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=16008589011). 

Amazon’s actions suggest it aims to be a force in the grocery industry, but it faces fierce competition. Walmart dominates in the United States (28.5% market share) through its supercenters, Sam’s Clubs, and Neighborhood Markets. Other major competitors include Kroger (11.7%), Costco (6.7%), and Albertsons (5.6%). Amazon, with its Whole Foods and Amazon sales, only captures about 2.6% of the market. 

Competitors are also making inroads in digital grocery sales. Walmart and others are growing their online ordering, pickup, and delivery capabilities.

Can Amazon win market share in this industry? Specifically, can it match Costco, Kroger, or even Walmart in the next 5 years?
