UBER’S INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING was the most anticipated IPO of 2019, but excitement quickly dissipated. Investment banks initially estimated Uber’s value as high as $120 billion. But as the [IPO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) neared, Uber’s valuation slipped below $100 billion. On the morning of its IPO, the value had fallen to $82 billion, with a $45 share price, near the low end of the anticipated price range.  Even though it was priced low, it never received the characteristic pop in price after trading started. It actually [closed down 7.6%](https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-stumbles-in-trading-debut-11557503554) after the first day. Valuation at the end of day 1: a relatively somber $76 billon.  

Uber was a casualty of overhyped expectations. Pre-IPO investors viewed Uber like other tech startups: a platform similar to Facebook that could become competition-proof if it could take an early lead and scale up before anyone else did. Thus, backers championed its “blitzscaling” and ignored its huge financial losses. They argued it could overcome its losses if it continued to grow.

But reality set in as investors realized Uber was operating under very different environmental conditions than Facebook and other tech platforms. Uber still benefited from network effects (i.e., it became more valuable the more it was used), but not near as much as Facebook. [Customers proved finicky](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/04/17/techs-new-stars-have-it-all-except-a-path-to-high-profits) and were willing to jump to competitors for a cheaper price. Further, because of different cost structures, economies of scale were less potent for Uber than platforms in Facebook’s industry. Adding users makes Facebook more valuable to advertisers, but adding users costs Facebook almost nothing. (That’s why scaling up is so important to Facebook.) The same is not true for Uber: increasing ridership also increases driver costs (one of its largest expenses), which dampens the popular tech strategy of grow-until-your-profitable. What’s more, investors underplayed the costs Uber would face from brazenly ignoring government regulations. Facebook faced little regulation early on because it started a new industry. Uber, on the other hand, was challenging highly regulated taxi markets in New York and elsewhere, and [regulators responded by curtailing its service](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/8/17664424/new-york-uber-taxis-driver-law). By the end of fiscal year 2019, Uber had lost $8.5 billion from its annual operations. 

Uber’s story is a cautionary tale in the importance of understanding a firm’s environment and how it affects a firm’s strategies. Uber’s expenses are primarily variable costs, not fixed costs, which makes scaling less potent. Investors underappreciated the importance of government regulation in the industry (i.e., building bridges with regulators is more helpful than burning them). And investors were blind to (or ignored) the weaknesses in Uber’s network effects and the lack of customer-switching costs. Careful analysis of environmental conditions might have led to more measured assessments of Uber’s “[unicorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance))” status.

This second article in the series on strategy components reviews how the industry environment and macroenvironment affect the viability of strategies, as shown in Figure 1. As explained in the [first article](./the-strategy-components-framework), the strategy components framework divides a firm’s strategies into six core areas: customer, product, operations, partner, competitor, and finance components. This article explains the type of analysis that can help companies like Uber (and its investors) be successful.

## Industry environment
A firm’s industry environment shapes the viability of its strategies. Strategies that work well for firms in one industry may work poorly for firms in another. For example, firms in the media production industry face different industry constraints than firms in the airline industry. A movie studio’s costs are primarily fixed: it must pay producers, actors, and engineers regardless of how many customers watch its movies. Because the costs are fixed, a movie’s marketing strategy is critical for its success: the more viewers it persuades to go to the theater (and then watch again later online), the more profitable it is. Studios therefore tend to focus on their product component where they build marketing and positioning strategies. But an airline’s major costs, like fuel and crew wages, vary depending on the number of flights. This means big marketing pushes have much less effect on profit. Instead, airlines often focus on the operations component with strategies to increase efficiency, such as reducing turnaround times or flight delays.

Harvard economist Michael Porter developed a framework to help strategists make sense of their firm’s environment and choose better strategies. His framework, called Porter’s Five Forces, explains the competitive environment and the economic forces that influence profitability. Porter’s Five Forces framework examines (1) the threat of new entrants, (2) the intensity of competition among rivals, (3 and 4) the bargaining power of buyers and suppliers, and (5) threats from substitute products. Profitability in an industry falls when rivalry is intense, entering the industry is easy, buyers or suppliers are powerful, or there are good substitutes. When these forces are strong, an industry is less attractive because it is more difficult to earn profits.

Porter originally developed the framework to help firms choose which industries to enter and where to position themselves. But the framework also helps firms understand how to create successful strategies.

This article doesn’t delve into what makes competitive forces strong or weak. There are [excellent discussions of that elsewhere](https://hbr.org/2008/01/the-five-competitive-forces-that-shape-strategy). Instead, this article explores how those forces influence specific strategy components. For example, the threat of new entrants tends to affect customer and product components, whereas intensity of rivalry affects operations and competitor components.

### Threat of new entrants
When new rivals enter an industry, it tends to lower a firm’s profits. This threat requires incumbents to lower their prices to keep new entrants from stealing market share. If the threat of new entrants is high, strategists often focus on the customer or product components to make it harder for rivals to enter. Firms may expand into underserved customer segments to preempt new entrants looking for easy access points into the market. This is what Kellogg’s did when it identified a new segment of customers wanting foods focused on a healthy digestive tract. Its introduction of HI! Happy Inside cereal filled a new market niche that otherwise could have been exploited by a new entrant. Firm’s may also increase their marketing or reposition their products to make it more difficult for a customer to switch to a new entrant’s product. For example, Alaska Airlines offers its [Mileage Plan](https://www.alaskaair.com/content/mileage-plan) to frequent flyers, similar to other airlines in the industry. As customers accrue perks, it increases customers’ switching costs. 

Incumbents may at times focus on the partner component to reduce the threat from new entrants. The aim here is to organize the incumbents and erect regulatory barriers through governmental lobbying. For example, the [Hair Council](https://www.haircouncil.org.uk/index.html) in the UK lobbies parliament to make it mandatory for barbers and hairdressers to register with the government and meet certification requirements. This makes it more difficult for new entrants to enter the industry.

### Intensity of rivalry
Intense rivalry tends to lower a firm’s profits. If the intensity of rivalry is high because the industry is fragmented (i.e., has many small players), strategists often focus on their firm’s operations component. They may look for and deploy strategies that increase operational efficiency and lower costs. For instance, chicken farmers may adopt products like [MimicTec](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mimictec/about/) that directs chicks’ natural pecking behavior toward gaining weight faster. The largest cost in broiler production is feed, so operational improvements that improve weight gain are critical. Firms that are more efficient than their rivals can price competitively and still earn a profit.

Strategists may also focus on the competitor component. They might analyze competitors to find acquisition targets. This is how CVS helped change the retail pharmacy landscape. [CVS started in 1963](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Health) as a small health and beauty products retailer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Along with new store openings, CVS fueled its growth through acquisitions. It bought 84 Clinton Drug and Discount stores in 1972, 37 Mack Drug stores in 1977, and Boston-based Heartland Drug in 1988. Its growth accelerated in the 1990s. It acquired 500 Peoples Drug stores in 1990, 2,500 Revco drug stores in 1997, and 207 Arbor Drugs stores in 1998. CVS’s acquisitions changed the competitive landscape, lowering the intensity of rivalry and increasing its own scale economies and buying power.

### Power of buyers and suppliers
When buyers are powerful, they can negotiate down a firm’s price; when suppliers are powerful, they can negotiate up a firm’s supply costs. If either buyer or supplier power is high, strategists often focus on the partner component. The goal is to turn competitive relationships into cooperative ones. For example, a small supplier may convey to a large manufacturer its willingness to become an innovation partner. By being willing to innovate, the small supplier may generate cost savings that benefit the supplier and buyer. Suppliers have done this with Honda. Honda is known for working with partners to develop them into “[super suppliers](https://www.proquest.com/docview/235109851?).” Their relationships are close, collaborative, and built on trust. In the 1990s, Honda was able to reduce its supply costs by 19% even as their competitors’ costs rose. At the same time, the super suppliers benefited from Honda’s help and became much more efficient. Similarly, a small reseller may work with a large original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to become a test site for new sales ideas. These partner strategies turn negotiations about distribution (i.e., that are primarily about price, which a small supplier or reseller will lose) into negotiations about integration where both parties can win.

### Threat of substitutes
When substitutes are readily available in the market, firms face greater price pressure lest customers switch. If the threat of substitutes is high, strategists may focus on customer and product strategies. They may speak with customers to understand why their product provides value over any substitutes. Strategists can use those customer insights to further differentiate products through marketing or design enhancements. For example, in 2017 the [beef industry resurrected a 25-year-old tagline](https://www.wsj.com/articles/beef-industry-aims-to-herd-millennials-with-nostalgic-ad-1507201382), “Beef. It’s what’s for dinner.” The industry had been [losing out to the poultry industry](https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/statistics/per-capita-consumption-of-poultry-and-livestock-1965-to-estimated-2012-in-pounds/) as consumers selected healthier and less costly alternatives to beef. The ad campaign appealed to millennials who nostalgically remember the [original national advertising campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tviyAIS9c_U).

### Using Porter’s Five Forces
When conducting industry analysis, it is not enough to simply examine the five competitive forces to see if they are strong or weak. The analysis should inform decisions within the six strategy components. For example, it’s clear that when Uber enters a new city, entrenched incumbents will use partner strategies to enact government regulations that keep (or kick) Uber out. For existing taxi companies, Uber is the new-entrant threat. [As some have argued](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ubers-one-way-street-to-regulation-11574776309), Uber should engage in similar partner strategies to counteract regulatory barriers or help craft regulations to their advantage. Furthermore, there are few natural barriers to keep new entrants like Lyft from entering an Uber market. Uber knows this, and has taken a page from the airline playbook: they launched [Uber rewards](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/22/uber-loyalty-program/) in 2019 to create customer loyalty and increase switching costs. 

## Macroenvironment
The macroenvironment affects business conditions broadly for many industries. When macroenvironmental conditions are stable, firms become accustomed to operating within them and largely ignore them. But when conditions change, they can upend industries and firms. Thus, strategists watch for macroenvironmental trends and adapt their strategy components when needed. The overall macroenvironment includes macroeconomic, technological, demographic, societal, ecological, and political and legal conditions.

### Macroeconomic conditions
The health of the U.S. and global economies affects demand in most industries. Some industries, like construction, are procyclical, meaning they tend to grow when the economy is good. Other industries, like higher education, are countercyclical and grow when the economy slows. During the Great Recession of 2007–09, the U.S. construction industry lost [1.5 million jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/construction-industry-after-recession-140430175.html), while enrollment in colleges and universities grew. In the 2010s, long and widespread economic growth left contractor companies scrambling to hire enough qualified workers because of strong demand. At the same time, it left higher-ed institutions scrambling to fill classroom seats because of tepid demand. Firms that observe macroeconomic conditions can forecast changes in customer demand, which helps them craft operations strategies for production and labor. Firms can also predict whether rivalry is likely to increase or decrease and adjust competitor strategies accordingly. 

Furthermore, macroeconomic conditions affect capital financing strategies. During the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve dropped the target [federal funds rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp), which affects lending rates broadly, to 0.00%–0.25%. And it did not raise rates again until years later, in 2016. This made debt financing extremely cheap for firms. The Fed again cut rates to near-zero when the COVID-19 pandemic spread to the United States. 

### Technological conditions
Technologies tend to improve incrementally over long stretches of time and then dramatically improve in sudden bursts of radical, disruptive innovation. These sudden bursts, called discontinuities, create a flourish of novel competing technologies with one finally winning out as the dominant design. Once an industry settles on a dominant design, innovation tends to return to predictable incremental improvements. Innovation scholars Philip Anderson and Michael Tushman found this [pattern of punctuated change](http://www.iot.ntnu.no/innovation/norsi-pims-courses/laursenfoss/Anderson%20&%20Tushman%20(1990).pdf) in the cement manufacturing industry throughout the twentieth century. The technologies underlying the kilns used to make cement went through cycles of revolution in the 1900s, 1960s, and 1970s followed by spans of incremental change. They documented similar cycles in the window glass and computer industries.

Firms that watch for these cycles can adjust their strategy components as their industries move from incremental to radical change and back. Often, firms must radically change their strategy components during discontinuities or risk being left behind. One firm that failed to survive a market revolution was Eastman Kodak. Kodak rose to prominence in the film industry for most of the twentieth century because of its chemical film innovations paired with its marketing prowess. [Kodachrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrRRhoS3KFk) (Kodak’s high-end film) and “[Kodak moments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r1Q8pETCSk” became part of popular culture. Kodak earned substantial profit margins on its film sales and film development services. But global sales of traditional film cameras [peaked in 1997](http://www.cipa.jp/stats/report_e.html) and were surpassed by digital cameras by 2002. The first iPhone, with a built-in camera, was launched in 2007. Kodak’s revenues quickly vanished and it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2012. 

Interestingly, Kodak did not fail from lack of innovation. It invented the first digital camera in 1975. It owned and licensed important digital photography patents. And it was the manufacturer behind Apple’s first digital camera, the QuickTake 100. But the margins on traditional film were too good to let go of, and most employees were skilled in chemical sciences, not electrical engineering. Thus, Kodak was slow to change its business and failed to reinvent itself.

### Demographic conditions
Demographic shifts affect demand in many industries. Demographers track trends in population growth, disposable income, and mobility using race, ethnicity, age, and gender classifications. In 2020, there were 35 million adults over the age of 65 in the United States, and that number is [expected to double](https://www.nia.nih.gov/living-long-well-21st-century-strategic-directions-research-aging/introduction) over the next 25 years. The growth in older populations is making the U.S. home healthcare market surge. Seniors spent [over $100 billion in 2019](https://homehealthcarenews.com/2019/02/home-health-spending-rate-projected-to-surpass-all-other-care-categories/), and forecasters believe it will grow 7% year over year through at least 2026. As with macroeconomic conditions, firms that monitor demographic conditions can forecast changes to demand and adjust their strategy components accordingly.

### Societal conditions
General tastes, preferences, and social norms shift over time. These shifts can rearrange customer segments and generate new segments. For example, the popularity of organic foods has steadily increased since the start of the twenty-first century. In 2000, organics constituted 1.3% of overall U.S. food sales (about $6 billion) according to the USDA. But by 2018, that number had [grown to $48 billion](https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/13805-us-organic-food-sales-near-48-billion), or 5.7% of overall sales. 

Social trends can also spur new ways to market and position products. Consumers, particularly millennials and the younger iGen, have shown an increasing desire for corporations to be socially aware, which has led some firms to adopt “woke advertising,” with varying degrees of success and backlash. The Procter & Gamble brand Always (maker of menstrual pads and other feminine products) was lauded for its [#LikeAGirl campaign](http://youtube.com/watch?v=XjJQBjWYDTs), which raised awareness of how labeling can harm a girl’s self-esteem as she reaches puberty. When Gillette, another P&G brand and razor manufacturer, tried to [tackle toxic masculinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0), responses to its messaging [were mostly sour](https://theconversation.com/razor-burned-why-gillettes-campaign-against-toxic-masculinity-missed-the-mark-109932). But no woke advertising has probably been more reviled than [Pepsi’s ad with Kendall Jenner](https://time.com/4726500/pepsi-ad-kendall-jenner/), which intended “to project a global message of unity, peace, and understanding” but instead projected callousness. Pepsi pulled the ad the day after it debuted.

### Ecological conditions
Ecological conditions such as pollution, climate change, and resource depletion can also affect firms in a broad range of industries. Catastrophic events can disrupt supply chains, and environmental issues can impinge on operations strategies. For example, [global insured losses from wildfires](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/09/19/changing-weather-could-put-insurance-firms-out-of-business) during 2010–18 totalled $41 billion. Pacific Gas and Electric, California’s biggest power company, declared bankruptcy in 2019 due to mounting losses from fire-damage claims it must pay. Its aging electrical grid started multiple deadly fires in 2017 and 2018. The dual issues of underinvestment in its grid alongside housing expansion into fire-prone areas were [exacerbated by drier climate](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/01/10/californias-biggest-utility-is-in-deep-trouble). Across the Australian continent, [tens of millions of acres burned](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/world/australia/fires-climate-change.html?auth=login-google) during the 2019–20 summer season and [destroyed the habitats of threatened species](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/australian-fires-incinerated-habitats-threatened-species-ecological-disaster). With the severity and frequency of weather events increasing, firms in high-risk areas will suffer more frequent disruptions and will find insurance more difficult to get. These ecological trends will require new risk models when planning operations strategies.

### Political and legal conditions
Politics shape the legal and regulatory environments that firms work within. When new regulations are enacted, firms might face substantial rework of their operations strategies. After the Enron and WorldCom scandals, the U.S. passed the Sarbanes–Oxley Act in 2002. This new law increased the oversight and internal audit obligations of public company managers. 

In 2016, European nations became alarmed at the amount of data that Facebook, Google, and other tech companies were collecting about E.U. citizens. So the [E.U. passed the General Data Protection Regulation](https://www.economist.com/business/2018/04/05/europes-tough-new-data-protection-law) (GDPR), which gave citizens the right to have their data corrected or completely deleted. It also placed harsh new penalties on companies that do not comply. The rules affect all multinational companies that collect data in Europe, not just European firms. 

In the U.S., Republican administrations tend to relax regulations on business, whereas Democratic administrations tend to tighten them. The ebb and flow of restrictions impact the cost structures of heavily-regulated firms such as those in extractive industries (e.g., coal, natural gas). 

Regulations can change the competitive landscape and shift power positions across industries. These changes can raise a need for changes within the competitor component. For example, the Federal Communication Commission’s debates on [net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality) became raucous in the 2010s. Much was at stake for internet service providers like Comcast (which maintains the physical distribution or the “pipes”) and online companies like Netflix and Google who use the pipes that Comcast and others own. Net neutrality was enacted during the Obama administration and limited internet providers’ ability to charge online companies different prices based on their usage. (Net neutrality is not about consumer rates.) When the FCC removed the net neutrality regulations in 2017, it freed Comcast to charge Netflix more for internet access than lighter users. Not surprisingly, Google and Netflix support net neutrality while Comcast is glad to see it gone. 

Political leaders also have legitimizing and ostracizing power that can affect firms, particularly as their sway over subpopulations has increased with the noted rise in [identity politics](https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/09/18/global-rise-of-identity-politics-event-6951). Large firms especially can be targets of praise or scorn. Facebook, getting no love from anyone, was castigated by Democrats for [not fact-checking political ads](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/facebook-ignores-critiques-of-its-political-ads-policy.html) while Republicans charged that it was [censoring conservative voices](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/10/facebook-google-twitter-under-fire-senate-republicans-censoring-conservatives-online/). And McDonald’s, Walmart, and Amazon are often [called out by Democrats for paying low wages](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/15-dollar-minimum-wage-democratic-candidates-find-an-easy-target-in-mcdonalds-pay/) and combating union organizing campaigns. These types of political challenges influence public opinion and can damage a firm’s public image. Firms commonly respond with public relations campaigns, which are a form of partner strategy. The firms rely on local communities for labor and on the [general public’s goodwill for legitimacy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2393494.pdf). The PR campaigns are intended to convince these partners to continue to provide labor and legitimacy.

### Using macroenvironmental analysis
Like Porter’s Five Forces, macroenvironmental analysis helps inform decisions in each strategy component. Demand trends, driven by macroeconomic or demographic changes, help inform operations and competitor strategies. Ecological trends influence operations strategies. Societal changes inform customer and product strategies. Political and legal conditions influence partner strategies. And technological discontinuities can completely upend a firm’s business and require radically reconfigured strategy components (or an entirely new business). Firms that study the macroenvironment can see trends and can create proactive strategies to adjust to the changing environment before it affects their business.
