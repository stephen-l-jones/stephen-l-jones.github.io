Peloton Interactive is an aspirational, tech-savvy fitness brand. It “burst onto the exercise scene several years ago with an aggressive marketing campaign that included storefronts with fit instructors working out on pricey exercise bikes,” [wrote Lauren Silva Loughlin and Dan Gallagher](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pelotons-ipo-is-in-the-zone-11569341944) in 2019 as Peloton prepared for its Initial Public Offering. The reporters noted, “While the expensive equipment makes the product inaccessible to the masses, Peloton has found a religious workout bunch.”  

Peloton’s brand burst ablaze in 2020 with pandemic lockdowns acting as an accelerant. But the pandemic fuel was gone by the summer of 2021 when new vaccines and warmer, longer days became ubiquitous. Now, it’s at risk of burning out completely.

What went wrong at Peloton and how can it recover?
