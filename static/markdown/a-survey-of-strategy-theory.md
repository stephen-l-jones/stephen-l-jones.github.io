NIKE HAS BEEN at the top of its game for over 30 years. It has built deep connections with each new generation of young consumers through its design and marketing prowess. Nike has continued its impressive growth even in the face of strong competition from Under Armour and lululemon, and even despite Adidas's acquisition of Reebok, two powerhouse brands. By 2019, Nike’s market capitalization was nearly $140 billion — twice the size of Adidas, its closest competitor. 

But Nike’s size and scope make it staggeringly complex. It sells products in three consumer goods industries (footwear, apparel, and equipment) through multiple distribution channels (wholesale, physical retail, and online direct-to-consumer). It markets to athletes in over a dozen sports (from basketball and football to cricket and lacrosse) in nearly every country in the world. In 2019, its supply chain included 112 contract footwear factories and 334 contract apparel factories in 30+ countries. 

With such a complex and large footprint, Nike runs the risk of becoming bureaucratic and lubberly. This is a major concern because new upstarts are always challenging Nike’s preeminence in one sport or another. How can Nike continue its superior growth and stay nimble at the same time?

McGinley Innovations has the opposite challenge. The small entrepreneurial shop is based in Casper, Wyoming. They developed an orthopedic drill that gives surgeons greater precision when drilling pin holes for joint replacements. It is the only medical device McGinley offers and it is patented. But while the drill offers unique benefits, McGinley struggles to get its story heard. Medical devices require massive investments in sales and marketing to reach doctors and hospitals globally. Billion-dollar firms like Medtronic and Boston Scientific are known to spend up to a third of their revenues on marketing and sales. How can McGinley extend its reach when competing against such powerful rivals?

The strategic questions that Nike and McGinley face are very different, yet they are linked by a common overarching question: _How do we achieve superior performance?_

Strategic management theory attempts to answer this question. It is built on economic and behavioral principles and on decades of observing market forces and inter- and intra-firm interactions. It aims to provide guidance to CEOs, entrepreneurs, and general managers who make business-level decisions. 

## Scholars debate competitive advantage

The mechanisms or means for superior performance are known as competitive advantages. When the mechanisms or means persist for many years, they are known as sustained competitive advantages. 

Competitive advantages indicate that high-performing firms have certain characteristics — some kind of capabilities, resources, or strategies — that make them able to perform better than their rivals. 

Scholars have argued for decades about what gives firms competitive advantages. At first they questioned whether such advantages even exist. Once scholars agreed that competitive advantages do exist, they started debating vociferously about how firms gain and maintain competitive advantages. This latter debate continues today.

## Industry view

Industrial organization (IO) economists first suggested in the mid-20th century that firms gain a competitive advantage by participating in specific industries. They argued that firms in concentrated industries (i.e., industries with few rivals, such as oligopolies) could gain higher profits because they could tacitly collude to inflate prices. Thus, the primary concern of firms was to select an attractive industry in which to operate.

In the 1980s, Michael Porter, a Harvard economist famous for his Five Forces industry analysis, expanded the theory beyond industry rivalry (or the lack thereof). He argued that strategists must also consider supply chain dependencies, substitute products, and entry barriers to understand an industry’s profit potential. While Porter’s framework was more robust, it still assumed that firms’ profits were determined by the industries in which they competed. These theories assumed that firms were relatively homogenous within an industry (though Porter recognized differences among strategic groups of firms within industries). Any differences between firms were transitory blips that dissipated as rivals quickly copied any efficiencies that other firms possessed. Differences between industries was the primary driver of firm performance, according to IO economists.

<p>Evidence does suggest that industries affect firm performance. Figure 1 shows the global profitability of 85 non-financial industries. Profitability is measured as return on invested capital (ROIC)<a href="#endnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a> after subtracting the cost of capital.<a href="#endnote-2"><sup>2</sup></a> It is based on 2018 data for public companies around the world. Figure 1 illustrates big differences between industries. For example, the tobacco industry had an ROIC of 34% above its cost of capital, the highest out of all industries. The healthcare services industry had an ROIC of 19% above its cost of capital. And the auto industry and telecom industries had an ROIC of 2% and 5% below their cost of capital, respectively.</p>

Even though evidence pointed to the importance of industry, there were limitations to focusing on industry exclusively. The industry-level theories only gave strategists tools to analyze industries and choose where to compete. The theories did not arm strategists with tools to make decisions within an industry. 

Thus, new theories emerged in the 1980s and ’90s that challenged the assumption that firms were homogenous within industries. These new theories argued that firms in the same industries possessed persistent differences in efficiency due to managerial talent or operational acumen that, for one reason or another, was sticky — that is, it did not dissipate quickly. Strategy scholar Richard Rumelt demonstrated in 1991 that variability in firm performance was due to differences in firm attributes more than to differences in industry characteristics. He showed that some firms have resources that differentiate them from their peers, and these differences matter greatly for performance. His work, along with theory developed by scholars Birger Wernerfelt, Jay Barney, Margaret Peteraf, and others, led to the resource-based view of firm performance.

## Resource-based view

The resource-based theory argues that firms gain a competitive advantage by acquiring or developing resources that allow them to produce products with greater value or lower cost than rivals’ products. To the extent that resource endowments persist and cannot be copied by competitors, firms may sustain a competitive advantage. The resource-based view implies that firms have the potential to be profitable in nearly any industry. Firm performance is not a product of industry effects alone. The resource-based view argues that strategists can analyze their firms’ industries and their firms’ internal characteristics to determine how to grow their resource endowments and gain a competitive advantage.

But those in the industrial economics camp pushed back on Rumelt’s findings, showing that variance in firm profitability depends greatly on the industry one observes. In some industries, all firms earn similar profits, suggesting that industry effects mainly determine profitability. In other industries, profits vary greatly, suggesting resource endowments largely drive the difference. This debate still continues to some extent, but the main takeaway is this: industries set constraints on firms’ potential profitability, but firms have opportunities within those constraints to develop strategies that give them a competitive advantage.

Figure 2 illustrates that profitability in some industries cluster together because of industry characteristics, while other industries allow for much greater variability. But even in tightly-clustered industries, firms demonstrate substantial differences in performance.

The dots indicate the ROIC over a 3-year period for large public U.S. firms in six industries (selected firms are identified by their stock tickers and orange dots). It also indicates the industry average ROIC (solid lines) and cost of capital (dotted lines) for the combined firms. For example, the soft drinks industry averaged a 24% ROIC (well above its cost of capital), whereas the telecom services industry averaged just 6% (slightly below its cost of capital). But these stark contrasts between industries ignore the even larger differences within them. For example, the ROIC for T-Mobile (TMUS) was near its industry’s average, but the ROIC for Spok (SPOK), a communications provider for hospitals, was 33%, which is well above even the soft drink industry’s average. At the bottom end of the telecom industry was Boingo Wireless (WIFI), a provider of wireless connectivity at public venues, with an ROIC of −19%. The auto and soft drink industries also showed wide variability in firm profitability. Coke’s (KO) ROIC was 13%, Pepsi’s (PEP) was 28%, Dr. Pepper Snapple’s (DPS) was 48%, and National Beverage Corp. (FIZZ), the owner of Shasta and La Croix, was a staggering 100%. 

Notice that the variation between firms in the air transport, grocery, and apparel industries is much lower. For instance, Kate Spade (KATE) in the apparel industry had an ROIC of 22%, which topped the industry, and Vince (VNCE) at the bottom of the industry had an ROIC of −2%, which is a span of only 24 percentage points. 

In subsequent decades, strategy scholars criticized the resource-based view for its short-comings, but none of these criticisms targeted the notion of heterogeneous (i.e., varying) firm performance within industries. Newer theories adopted a similar position to the resource-based view: firm performance can vary within an industry due to differences in firm choices and endowments. But these theories also extended the resource-based view in important ways.

### Knowledge-based view

One important extension is the knowledge-based view, posited by strategy scholar Robert Grant. Grant proposed that the most valuable resources a firm has are knowledge resources. In this view, firms must employ vast amounts of knowledge effectively to gain a competitive advantage. The challenge they face is that their knowledge resources reside within individual employees — in their skills, expertise, and cooperative abilities. Thus, firms need to organize their work and workers in cooperative ways so knowledge can be integrated toward productive ends. Because this theory focuses heavily on the knowledge and skills of individuals, it led to a surge in interest in strategic human capital. 

The value of the knowledge-based view is illustrated by Boeing’s ability to design and manufacture the 787 aircraft. Boeing engaged thousands of individual engineers with expertise in propulsion, structures, heat transfer, systems, and other technical areas to design the 787. The engineers were organized in project teams to address specific engineering requirements, and the teams coordinated their work through agreed-upon design interfaces. The complex web of requirements, designs, tests, and manufacturing were orchestrated through scores of program and project managers. Boeing would not have been successful at developing the 787 without its ability to coordinate and integrate its employees’ knowledge.

### Problem-solving perspective

The knowledge-based view was further extended with a problem-solving perspective, proposed by Jack Nickerson and Todd Zenger. While the knowledge-based view focuses on integrating existing knowledge effectively, the problem-solving perspective advocates that firms must be concerned with how to generate new, unique, and valuable knowledge that can lead to a competitive advantage. To generate valuable knowledge, firms must first select the “right” problems or challenges to solve. The right problems are the ones with a high potential to have valuable solutions that will not be too costly to discover. The firms must also be able to capture and sustain the value created by the solution. Further, the nature of the problem dictates how to organize to find a solution for it.

The problem-solving perspective is illustrated by the pharmaceutical companies Merk and Pfizer. They could deploy R&D resources to develop treatments for a host of diseases and ailments. But only a subset of those are likely to lead to valuable, new knowledge. So the pharmaceutical firms gauge the probability of success at developing new drugs and their ability to recuperate their R&D costs and earn a profit. Based on their analysis, the firms organize their research teams around specific problems.

### Relational view

Another extension of the resource-based view, proposed by strategy scholars Jeff Dyer and Harbir Singh, is the relational view of competitive advantage. They proposed that firms can develop unique and valuable resources through cooperation with strategic partners (e.g., buyers and sellers) and that these resources inhere within the firm-partner relationship. These relationships reduce transaction costs (e.g., costs associated with business-to-business exchange), create new knowledge, and generate value-creation opportunities that otherwise would not exist. The relational view is similar to the knowledge-based view that knowledge must be integrated to create unique value. But while the knowledge-based view focuses on knowledge integration within firms, the relational-view focuses on knowledge integration between firms. 

The value of the relational view is seen in Toyota and other Japanese firms that are embedded in keiretsus. A keiretsu is a type of business group in Japan that allows for trust to build between firms. Toyota and its suppliers hold equity in each other’s businesses. Toyota shares its engineering talent and development plans with suppliers, which demonstrates its long-term commitment to them. In contrast, U.S. auto manufacturers have historically held a combative relationship with their suppliers and negotiated mainly on price. Because of Toyota’s strong relationships with its suppliers, it can solve design and manufacturing problems quickly, and the cost to monitor suppliers is lower.

### Demand-side perspective

Finally, strategy scholars Ron Adner and Peter Zemsky recognized that the resource-based view ignores the importance of customers and market segments (i.e., customer heterogeneity) for competitive advantage. They point out that the resource-based view is a supply-side theory. That is, it focuses on the producer side of a producer-buyer transaction. They proposed a complementary demand-side perspective on competitive advantage. They recognize that the value that a differentiated product provides to a customer often erodes over time. Thus, firms’ valuable and rare resources that have driven competitive advantage in the past may not continue to do so into the future as customers find less value in the high-end products those resources create. Furthermore, firms’ opportunities to develop unique resources are dependent on the extent to which an industry can be segmented into different markets. When customer tastes are diverse, an industry can be divided into many segments. In a segmented industry, firms can develop resources tailored to specific areas. In contrast, if there is little variation in customer tastes, firms within an industry will seek to develop similar resources — quickly wearing down firms’ competitive advantages.

The history of Apple’s iPhone products provides an example of the demand-side perspective in action. Apple has long held valuable resources in industrial design and product innovation, which led to the creation of the iPhone, one of the most profitable technologies ever sold. But its ability to command ever-higher premiums started to erode by the end of 2018. Competitors began providing products that rivaled the iPhone, and customers began to show less willingness to pay a premium. Although its competitive advantage is still very strong, Apple’s valuable design and innovation resources began to, in essence, lose some potency. (Apple recognized this, and it began to move toward services in 2019.)

## Applying strategy theory 

Firms and industries are complex. It’s not surprising that a lot of theories exist to explain them. Each theory can be useful when crafting strategy, and it is important to understand the power and pitfalls of a theoretical framework. 

Strategy theories prompt strategists to focus on different aspects of their business. For example, when using IO economics theories, a strategist will look at an industry’s competitive environment. When using the resource-based view, a strategist will focus on a firm’s internal resources. This is important to recognize because applying only one theory could mean a strategist misses an important insight that another theory highlights. It is useful to look at a strategic question from multiple theoretical viewpoints.

Some theories will be more or less useful depending on the strategic question. Porter’s Five Forces framework is useful to understand economic forces at play within an industry. The resource-based view helps firms understand where investments inside the firm may be needed. The knowledge-based view is helpful when organizing workflows and crafting firm design. The problem-based and demand-based perspectives are useful when making product and target market choices. And the relational view is helpful when selecting partner strategies. 

Also, it is important to recognize the limitations of these theories. While theories developed in IO economics can help strategists react to market forces, they do not help strategists discover how their firm might shape its industry. And while the resource-based view helps strategists build their firm’s valuable and rare capabilities, it does not alert them to threats from changing consumer preferences or market demand. Further, none of the strategies reviewed here provide guidance on how to implement the strategies. They only suggest what to do in a given situation.

The true benefit of a strategy theory is that it can guide strategists in a wide variety of situations and industries. Strategy theories are built to be general and abstract. That’s why they can be applied to so many contexts. So whatever the situation — from corporate strategy at Nike to new venture growth McGinley Innovations — strategists who understand and use these strategy theories can gain new insights and improve their firm’s performance.

<p id="endnote-1" style="font-size: 1.0rem;">1. Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a ratio that indicates the profit created for every dollar invested, expressed as a percentage. ROIC is calculated using only operating profits, which are profits generated by operating the business. ROIC excludes profits or losses related to financing decisions (e.g., debt vs. equity financing) or other non-operating decisions (e.g., gains on marketable securities, for non-bank firms). Because ROIC is a percentage, it allows analysts to compare the performance of firms of different sizes.</p>
<p id="endnote-2" style="font-size: 1.0rem;">2. For firms to create economic value, they must earn an ROIC higher than their cost of capital. The cost of capital is the rate of return that investors expect if they supply capital to a firm. It is normally measured as the weighted average of the explicit interest rate of a firm’s debt and the implied interest rate of a firm’s equity. If a firm fails to generate an ROIC above its cost of capital, then investors lose economic value because those investors could have placed their capital in another entity (with a similar level of risk) and generated a higher return. In other words, a firm destroys value when it fails to reach its cost of capital because the capital could have been employed more productively somewhere else.</p>
