NIKE HAS BEEN at the top of its game for over 40 years. It has built deep connections with each new generation of young consumers through its design and marketing prowess. Nike sustained its impressive growth despite strong competition from long-time rivals like ASICS and newer brands like lululemon. In 2021, Nike’s market cap reached $250 billion⁠—three times the size of Adidas, its closest competitor. 

But Nike’s size and scope make it staggeringly complex. It sells footwear, apparel, and equipment through wholesale, retail, and direct-to-consumer channels in nearly every country in the world. It contracts with a vast network of manufacturers. And it markets to athletes in more than a dozen sports.

With such a complex and large footprint, Nike runs the risk of becoming bureaucratic and sluggish. This is a major concern because new upstarts are always challenging Nike’s preeminence. Indeed, recent missteps have cost it dearly. Its push into online sales left it vulnerable to competition on retail shelves. And it lost sight of its core running category, letting On and Hoka steal market share. In 2025, its revenues fell nearly 10%. 

McGinley Innovations has the opposite challenge. The small entrepreneurial shop based in Casper, Wyoming, developed an orthopedic drill that gives surgeons greater precision when drilling pin holes for joint replacements. While the drill offers unique benefits, McGinley struggles to get its brand recognized. Medical devices require massive investments to reach doctors and hospitals globally. Billion-dollar firms like Medtronic and Boston Scientific spend up to a third of their revenues on marketing and sales.

The challenges at large firms like Nike and small startups like McGinley differ, yet the strategy question underlying their challenges is the same: How can a firm achieve superior performance?

Strategic management theories provide answers to this fundamental question. They focus on *competitive advantages*⁠—the mechanisms that drive superior performance. The theories give executives and entrepreneurs tools for making better business decisions.

Strategy scholars built theories of competitive advantage by observing markets and firms. Over decades, they proposed and debated various mechanisms, including market features, firm resources, and strategic choices. They agreed that competitive advantages exist⁠—evidenced by many superior firms⁠—but vigorously disagreed about why. From these debates arose two pillars of strategy theory: the industry view and the resource-based view.

## Industry view
Early industrial organization (IO) economists argued that firms gain competitive advantages by participating in specific industries. [Their theory](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1814804.pdf), first introduced in the mid-20th century, asserts that concentrated industries bestow above-normal profits on the few large players within them. These firms earn higher profits because they can [tacitly collude](https://www.tutor2u.net/economics/reference/oligopoly-tacit-collusion)⁠—coordinating on prices without explicit agreement⁠—to keep prices high and push down input costs. This theory suggests a firm’s primary concern is choosing the right industry⁠—preferably one that is concentrated.

In the 1980s, Michael Porter expanded IO theory beyond industry rivalry. The Harvard economist, famous for his [Five Forces industry analysis](https://www.isc.hbs.edu/strategy/business-strategy/Pages/the-five-forces.aspx), argued that firms must consider other competitive forces as well, including supply chain dependencies, substitute products, and entry barriers. These combined forces constitute an industry’s profit potential. While more robust, Porter’s framework still suggests that a firm’s profits are determined by its industry. 

These IO theories assert that firms are relatively homogeneous within an industry (though Porter recognized differences among [strategic groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_group) of firms). Any differences between firms are transitory, quickly being erased as rivals copy one another’s efficiencies. In the IO view, a firm’s industry matters far more than anything the firm does.

Evidence suggests that industries affect firm performance. The profitability of 85 global industries in 2018 is shown in Figure 1, ordered by return on invested capital (ROIC)[^1] less the cost of capital.[^2] Industries on the left were highly profitable, including tobacco (34%), healthcare services (19%), and aerospace (13%). Industries on the right performed poorly. Autos and telecom had an ROIC of 2% and 5% *below* their cost of capital, respectively. 

![Figure 1. Industry return on invested capital less cost of capital](../img/industry-roic.png#small)

Yet focusing on industry alone has clear limitations. These theories help firms choose *where* to compete but offer little guidance on *how* to compete once there. 

New theories emerged in the 1980s and ’90s that challenged the assumption that firms are homogeneous within industries. These theories argue that firms in the same industry are internally distinct⁠—owing to managerial talent or operational skill⁠—and these internal distinctions create sticky performance differences that don’t dissipate quickly. Strategy scholar Richard Rumelt found support for this argument in 1991. [He showed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2486591.pdf) that variability in firm performance was due to differences in firm attributes more than differences in industry characteristics. His work, along with theory developed by scholars [Birger Wernerfelt](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/36254/b1379458.0001.001.pdf), [Jay Barney](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/014920639101700108), [Margaret Peteraf](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2486921.pdf), and others, led to the resource-based view of firm performance.

## Resource-based view
The resource-based view argues that firms create competitive advantages by gaining resources⁠—be they people, competencies, or otherwise⁠—that let them produce better products[^3] or lower costs relative to rivals. If those resources persist and cannot be copied by competitors, firms will sustain their advantages. The implication is powerful: firms have the potential to be profitable in nearly any industry. Performance is not a product of industry effects alone. This means firms should determine how to build or acquire resources that generate competitive advantages.

Those in the IO economics camp pushed back against the resource-based view. They followed up Rumelt’s study [with one of their own](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/%28SICI%291097-0266%28199707%2918%3A1%2B%3C15%3A%3AAID-SMJ916%3E3.0.CO%3B2-1), showing that the degree of variance in firm profitability depends on the industry. In some industries, all firms earn similar profits, suggesting that industry effects mainly determine profitability. In other industries, profits vary greatly, suggesting internal resources largely drive the difference. 

Figure 2 illustrates these differences in five industries in the United States from 2016-18. The circles indicate the profitability of the firms in each industry, measured by ROIC. The profitability of automotive firms varied widely, but the profitability of apparel firms stayed within a narrower band. This suggests apparel firms are constrained by their industry. 

![Figure 2. Return on invested capital of U.S. firms in selected industries](../img/firm-roic.png#small)

Yet the industry effects pale in comparison to individual firm effects. The industry average ROICs, indicated by the dashed lines, were quite similar, ranging from 7% to 12%, whereas the variation in individual firms’ ROICs was much larger. Even in apparel, the most constrained industry, firm profitability ranged from −2% to 24%. 

This debate about industry versus firm effects still continues to some extent, but the main takeaway is this: industries set constraints on firms’ potential profitability, but within those constraints firms can develop strategies that create competitive advantages and lead to superior performance.

In subsequent decades, scholars criticized the resource-based view on various grounds, but none challenged its core premise⁠—that firms have the power to shape their performance, whatever their industry. Indeed, newer theories build on this premise in important ways.

### Knowledge-based view
The [knowledge-based view](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/smj.4250171110), proposed by strategy scholar Robert Grant, argues that a firm’s most valuable resources are its knowledge assets. In this view, firms must harness and direct vast amounts of specialized knowledge to achieve their goals. Firms that do this well gain competitive advantages. The challenge is that knowledge resides within individual employees⁠—in their skills, expertise, and ability to collaborate. Firms therefore need to organize work and workers cooperatively so that dispersed knowledge can be harnessed. This theory focuses heavily on individual knowledge and skills, and it led to a surge in interest in [strategic human capital](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/smj.421). 

Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner illustrates the value of the knowledge-based view. Boeing drew on thousands of engineers with expertise in propulsion, structures, heat transfer, systems, and other technical areas to design it. The engineers were organized in project teams to address specific requirements, and the teams coordinated their work through agreed-upon design interfaces. The complex web of requirements, designs, tests, and manufacturing was orchestrated by scores of program and project managers. Boeing could not have developed the 787 without its ability to coordinate and integrate employee knowledge.

### Problem-solving perspective
The knowledge-based view was further extended with a [problem-solving perspective](https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1040.0093), proposed by scholars Jack Nickerson and Todd Zenger. Where the knowledge-based view focuses on integrating existing knowledge, the problem-solving perspective argues for organizing to efficiently generate new knowledge. The aim is to organize around a problem as its complexity dictates. It also argues that firms should seek the “right” problems to solve⁠—those whose solutions are likely to be valuable and not prohibitively costly to discover. Firms must also capture and sustain the value their solutions create. 

This perspective is illustrated by pharmaceutical R&D. Early drug discovery for novel mechanisms is extremely complex, requiring tight collaboration where chemists, biologists, and clinicians work closely together, sharing knowledge to navigate highly interdependent challenges. Later-stage work⁠—like optimizing manufacturing or refining formulations⁠—is less so and can be divided among specialized teams working more independently.

Companies like Pfizer and Novo Nordisk select problems likely to yield successful drugs and recoup costs. But sometimes they get it wrong. Pfizer funded early GLP-1 research [but abandoned it](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/936213), believing injections would never succeed commercially. Thirty years later, Pfizer watched from the sidelines as Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 injection, Ozempic, became a blockbuster weight-loss drug.

### Relational view
The [relational view](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/259056.pdf) argues that firms can develop competitive advantages by cooperating with strategic partners, such as suppliers, sellers, or even rivals. This extension of the resource-based view, introduced by scholars Jeff Dyer and Harbir Singh, reveals that unique, valuable resources can be embedded in relationships between firms, not just inside firms. These relationships reduce what economists call *transaction costs*⁠—or costs associated with business-to-business exchange. Strategic relationships can create new knowledge, product features, or efficiencies that otherwise would not be possible. The relational view is similar to the knowledge-based view in its focus on integrating specialized knowledge. But instead of focusing on integrating knowledge within a firm, the relational view focuses on integrating knowledge *between* firms.

Shopify’s strategic partnerships with Walmart and TikTok exemplify the relational view. In 2020, [Shopify partnered with Walmart](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace/), giving Shopify merchants access to Walmart’s 120 million online customers while providing Walmart with vetted sellers and a bigger marketplace to compete against Amazon⁠—something neither could achieve independently. Later that year, [Shopify integrated with TikTok](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/) so merchants could create shoppable video content and sell directly within the app. This partnership positioned Shopify at the forefront of social commerce, allowing merchants to reach Gen Z consumers better, and furthered TikTok’s e-commerce ambitions.

### Demand-side perspective
Strategy scholars Ron Adner and Peter Zemsky recognized that the resource-based view largely ignores customers. It is a supply-side theory focused solely on producers, not buyers. Adner and Zemsky proposed a complementary [demand-based perspective](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/smj.513). Their key insight is that firms in innovative industries face diminishing marginal utility (DMU)⁠—meaning customers’ willingness to pay for product improvements erodes over time⁠—so resources that once drove competitive advantage may lose their edge.

The demand-side perspective also highlights the role of market segmentation. When customer tastes are diverse, an industry can support multiple segments, and firms can develop resources tailored to specific niches. But when customer preferences are relatively uniform, the market tends toward a single dominant strategy. This pushes firms to acquire similar resources, eroding any competitive advantages.

The history of Apple’s iPhone exemplifies the demand-side perspective. Apple held valuable resources in industrial design and product innovation, which led to the creation of the iPhone, one of the [most profitable technologies ever sold](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/apples-iphone-the-most-profitable-product-in-history-10009741.html). But its ability to command ever-higher premiums [started to erode](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-posts-drop-in-quarterly-revenue-and-profit-11548797780) by the end of 2018. Customers showed a decreasing willingness to pay for incremental improvements in camera quality, processing speed, and screen resolution. The diminishing utility of each iPhone release was compounded by the release of comparable rival phones. Although its competitive advantage was still strong, Apple’s valuable design and innovation resources lost some of their potency. (Apple recognized this, and it began to [move toward platform services](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-profit-slips-13-as-iphone-sales-continue-to-slump-11564520326) in 2019.)

## Applying strategy theory 
Firms and industries are complex. It is not surprising that many theories exist to explain them. Some theories will be more useful than others in a given situation, so it is important to understand the power and pitfalls of a theoretical framework. 

Strategy theories direct attention to different aspects of a business, thus delivering different strategic insights. IO economic theory and Porter’s Five Forces framework direct focus toward an industry’s competitive environment, which highlights the economic forces at play. The resource-based view directs focus toward a firm’s internal resources, which reveals capabilities a firm should strengthen. Applying only one theory could mean missing an important insight that another theory highlights.

Different theories have different strategic applications. The knowledge-based view and problem-solving perspective help when organizing workflows, crafting firm design, and choosing new innovation paths. The relational view helps when selecting and crafting strategic partnerships. And the demand-side perspective helps with incremental innovation and product strategy. Thus, the strategic question at hand dictates which theoretical viewpoints are most helpful.

Also, it is important to recognize the limitations of these theories. While IO economic theory can help firms react to market forces, it does not explain how firms might shape their industries. And while the resource-based view helps firms build valuable and rare capabilities, it does not alert them to threats from changing consumer preferences or market demand. Further, none of the theories reviewed here provide guidance on how to implement strategy. They suggest what to do but not how to do it.

The true benefit of these strategy theories is the guidance they provide in a wide variety of situations and industries. Strategy theories are built to be general and abstract. That is why they can be applied to so many contexts. So whatever the situation⁠—from corporate strategy at Nike to new-venture growth at McGinley Innovations⁠—firms that understand these strategy theories can gain fresh insights and improve their performance.

[^2]. For firms to create economic value, they must earn an ROIC higher than their cost of capital. The cost of capital is the rate of return that investors expect given a firm’s risk profile. If a firm fails to generate an ROIC above its cost of capital, then investors lose⁠—they could have employed their capital more productively elsewhere.
