INTELLIGENT STRATEGY builds on the principles of value creation and value capture, which are rooted in microeconomics. This article is a primer on these principles. 

## Industries
Strategy begins with understanding your industry. An industry comprises products or services that serve the same customer need. This means products in an industry are _close substitutes_ for each other. In the soft drink industry, an A&W root beer easily substitutes for a Coke or Dr. Pepper, even if a consumer prefers one over the other. And a flight on Frontier Airlines easily substitutes for one on Delta or Alaska, even if the service is worse. 

Your industry’s boundary defines your rivals. Yet sometimes that boundary is hard to define. For instance, should soft drinks include a Starbucks bottled Frappuccino sold at Safeway? Yes⁠—if customers see bottled coffee and a Coke as close substitutes. And if they do, Starbucks and Coke are rivals, at least for their grocery products. 

Industries sit on a continuum of competitiveness. _Perfectly competitive markets_ are the most competitive. They have many firms selling identical products, and firms are “price takers,” meaning they must accept the market price and cannot influence it. Commodities like sugar or rubber approach perfect competition.

_Monopolies_ have no competition. They consist of only one firm, which sets the industry price. Their dominance pushes governments to regulate them. For example, [PacifiCorp](https://www.pacificorp.com/), a utility, must seek approval from public utility commissions in the states it services to increase electricity prices.

At these extremes of the competitive continuum, the scope of potential strategies is restricted. In (near) perfectly competitive markets, firms are limited to efficiency strategies to keep costs low. In monopoly markets, most strategies deal with political and regulatory issues. Still, in industries between these extremes, firms can choose from a breadth of options.

This middle ground includes industries with _monopolistic competition_ and _oligopolies_. Industries with monopolistic competition have less rivalry and higher barriers to entry than perfectly competitive markets. But they are far from monopolies. Competition is intense and the threat of new entrants is constant. They are called “monopolistic” because products in these industries are different enough to have distinctive demand curves. The global apparel and footwear industry is an example. Large brands like Nike, H&M, and Zara, a Spanish retailer, build loyalty and custom demand for their shoes and fast fashion. But they comprise only a small part of the trillion-dollar industry. They can influence prices given their brand power, but their power is curtailed by aggressive rivals. 

Competitiveness in [oligopolies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligopoly) is lower than in industries with monopolistic competition. Oligopolies have a limited number of rivals, high barriers to entry, and a high minimum efficient scale, which pushes firms to be big to run efficiently. The U.S. mobile telecom industry is an example. Three companies⁠—Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T⁠—held 99% of the market share in 2025. With so few rivals, players in oligopolistic markets can [tacitly collude](https://www.tutor2u.net/economics/reference/oligopoly-tacit-collusion) to raise prices. Parallel price increases that are uncoordinated are legal in the United States, but they can attract scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission or Justice Department, which police anticompetitive practices.

## Customer Demand
Economists and marketers represent customer demand within an industry using a demand curve. A demand curve represents customers’ willingness to pay for a product. To illustrate this point, imagine we sell a fictional garment called a “thneed,” from Dr. Seuss’s [_The Lorax_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNMBVVdrMKo). For simplicity, assume we are a monopolist (we own all known Truffula trees) and can price as we wish. Customers value a thneed differently; some are willing to pay more than others. 

To create our thneed demand curve, we collected customer data and grouped customers by their willingness to pay, as shown in Figure 1. Four hundred will pay $91 for a thneed, another 400 will pay $84 for one, another 400 will pay $77, and so forth. Grouping customers this way reveals the relationship between the price we set and the quantity demanded. At $100 no customers will buy a thneed. But 4,000 customers will buy a thneed at $40, and 8,000 customers will buy one at $10.

![Figure 1. Thneed demand curve](../img/micro-fig-1.png)

## Maximizing profit
We want to choose a price for our thneed that will maximize economic profit.[^1] (Assume we are not engaged in [price discrimination](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_discrimination.asp).) Figure 2 illustrates a range of options. The first column shows revenues at different prices and production levels (i.e., quantities). The second column shows costs. And the third column combines revenues and costs to show profits.

Each row presents a slightly different view of revenues, costs, and profits. The first row shows per-unit or average values. The second row shows total values (per-unit values multiplied by the quantity, shown in thousands of dollars). The third row shows marginal or incremental values. Marginal values show how revenue, cost, or profit change when our firm produces one more unit. 

To illustrate our options, I have chosen three prices and production levels to analyze: $76 at quantity `q_1` = 1,240 thneeds; $18 at `q_2` = 6,670 thneeds; and $49 at `q*` = 3,200 thneeds, which is the price at which total profit is greatest. 

![Figure 2. Thneed revenue, costs, and profits](../img/micro-fig-2.png#small)

### Revenues (plots 1, 4, 7)
Plot 1 of Figure 2 replicates the demand curve of Figure 1. The shaded area depicts total revenue at `q*`, which is $49 × 3,200 = $156,800. Plot 4 shows total revenue at various production levels. The total revenue at `q_1` is $94,240. This is lower than total revenue at `q*` because the higher price at `q_1` does not compensate for the lower quantity. At `q_2` total revenue is $120,060, which is lower than at `q*` because the higher quantity does not compensate for the lower price.

Plot 7 shows marginal revenues. The marginal revenue (MR) at `q_1` is $55, meaning a production increase from 1,240 to 1,241 thneeds would add $55 to total revenue. At `q_2` MR is −$26 because the revenue from an extra sale does not offset the revenue lost from the lower price. At `q*` MR is $12. This means producing one more thneed would increase revenue⁠—indeed, producing another 800 thneeds would maximize revenue⁠—but it would not maximize profit, as detailed later.

### Costs (plots 2, 5, 8)
Plot 5 shows total costs. Total costs consist of fixed costs (the gray horizontal line) and variable costs (the gray upward curve). Fixed costs remain stable regardless of production level, at least in the short term. The fixed cost for our thneed business is $22,000. Variable costs increase as more thneeds are produced, but the rate of increase depends on the baseline production level. Increasing production from `q_1` increases variable costs slowly. The added production makes labor more efficient and earns us volume discounts on raw materials. But increasing production from `q_2` increases variable costs quickly. Management becomes difficult beyond `q_2`, which raises coordination costs. Total costs follow the curvature of variable costs but are shifted higher to account for fixed costs. The total cost at `q*` is $60,800.

Plot 2 depicts average fixed, variable, and total costs per thneed. Because fixed costs are stable, average fixed costs decrease as production increases. Average variable costs also drop initially but rise at higher production levels as coordination costs compound. The average total cost (ATC) is the sum of average fixed and variable costs. ATC is $34 at `q_1` and drops to $19 at `q*` as we gain economies of scale. ATC rises slightly to $20 at `q_2` as we start to hit diseconomies of scale. The shaded area captures total cost at `q*`, which is $19 × 3,200 = $60,800, the same as in plot 5. 

Plot 8 shows marginal costs, which are driven solely by variable costs (in the short term). At `q_1` the marginal cost (MC) of increasing production from 1,240 to 1,241 thneeds is $7. At `q*` the MC of producing one more thneed is $12. 

### Profits (plots 3, 6, 9)
We maximize profit at `q*`, where total revenue less total cost is greatest. This is depicted in plot 6, which combines plots 4 and 5 (total revenues and total costs). At `q*` total revenue is $156,800, total cost is $60,800, and total profit is $156,800 − $60,800 = $96,000. Notice that `q*` is lower than the quantity at which revenue peaks (4,000 thneeds). This is because total revenues level off after `q*` while total costs accelerate, closing the distance between them.

Notice also that in plot 9, MR (blue) equals MC (red) at the profit-maximizing quantity `q*`. In fact, profit is always greatest when MR equals MC, which is why they are calculated. Why does this always hold? Because marginal revenue and marginal cost represent the slopes of the total revenue and total cost curves (plot 6) at a given production level. When the total revenue curve is rising faster than the total cost curve, increasing production expands the distance between total revenue and total cost, which increases profit. But once the cost curve rises faster than the revenue curve, extra production narrows the gap and erodes profit. Thus, profit is greatest when the slopes of the revenue and cost curves match, as shown by the intersection in plot 9 (i.e., when MR = MC).

Plot 3 shows average profits per thneed. Profit is greatest when the production level maximizes the shaded area, which occurs at quantity `q*`. The height of the shaded area is average profit per thneed at `q*`, or $49 − $19 = $30. The width of the shaded area is the quantity, or 3,200 units. Thus, plot 3 also shows that the maximized profit is $30 × 3,200 = $96,000. 

## Value creation
### Customer value
To understand value creation, we first need to define customer value in an industry. _Customer value_ is the aggregate value that customers assign to an industry’s products.[^2] It is determined by customers’ willingness to pay, which is always relative to some alternative: a less-preferred product in the same industry, a substitute product from a separate industry, or simply no purchase at all. For our definition of customer value, only the latter two alternatives apply. 

To explain why, consider a passenger (we’ll call her Kara) who wants to fly to Las Vegas for vacation. Kara’s willingness to pay is the price at which, if fares rise any higher, she will not purchase a ticket from _any_ airline, choosing either to buy a substitute product (such as a bus ticket) or nothing at all (forgoing the trip). This is the price at which Kara is indifferent about sticking with or leaving the industry and defines the value she derives (for flights to Las Vegas). 

Normally, the price at which a customer will leave the industry is higher than the price at which the customer will switch to a less-preferred product in the same industry. For example, Kara will swap airlines rather than take a bus or cancel her trip when her preferred airline raises its fares. (She flies Frontier when Southwest’s fares rise.) Her choice between airlines captures industry competition, but it masks the total value of the industry. Kara’s willingness to pay for a Southwest vs. Frontier ticket doesn’t capture the full value commercial flight offers her. The full value is the price at which Kara will abandon flying altogether. Thus, customer value is the sum of all customers’ willingness to pay _relative to leaving the industry_.

Figure 3 depicts this aggregate willingness to pay, captured by the industry demand curve (`D`). It also depicts quantity (`Q`), which is the aggregate production of all firms in the industry. The shaded area (a) is the total customer value in the industry. As shown, customer value is bounded by both the industry demand curve and aggregate production. The area to the right of `Q` and under `D` is excluded from customer value. Firms don’t price their products low enough to bring those customers into the market, so their value isn’t realized.

![Figure 3. Value creation](../img/micro-fig-3.png)

### Value creation and firm “added value”
Customer value is created when the industry demand curve shifts outward and upward or when aggregate production increases, as illustrated in Figure 3. Value is created in area (b) when the industry demand curve shifts to `D′` (due to market changes) and `Q` remains stable (firms don’t expand production). Value is created in area (c) when firms lower prices and shift aggregate production to `Q′` while the industry demand curve remains stable. And value is created in areas (b), (c), and (d) when aggregate demand shifts to `D′` _and_ aggregate production shifts to `Q′`.

As described, value creation represents the aggregated value created by all firms within an industry. But what is the value that any one firm creates? We can answer this question, at least conceptually, using the “added value” principle. The principle states that the value created by a firm is the difference in the industry’s value with versus without the firm in it. In other words, a firm’s value is what would disappear from the industry if the firm vanished.

For example, consider two streaming services, Tubi (owned by Fox Corp.) and Peacock (owned by Comcast), which each streamed 10–15 billion hours of entertainment in 2024. Did they both create the same value that year? Unlikely. Tubi licensed over 99% of its content from others, much of which was available elsewhere. If Tubi and its minimal owned content suddenly disappeared, customers would simply turn to a different service for the same movies and shows, suggesting Tubi adds very little value to the overall streaming industry. However, if Peacock and its estimated $2.5 billion of owned content vanished, fans of its exclusive movies and shows would complain. (“What happened to _Love Island USA_!?”) The loss of Peacock would put a noticeable dent in the streaming industry’s overall value, which highlights its importance. (Of course, the loss of Tubi and Peacock pales by comparison to the hypothetical loss of Netflix, with its $20 billion of owned content!)

The added-value principle reveals how a firm can grow its value creation. It must enact strategies that customers value _and_ are novel, like introducing a pioneering product feature or innovative manufacturing process. Such strategies shift the industry demand curve outward or increase aggregate production (by attracting price-conscious customers to the industry). If a firm only imitates its rivals, it can capture value, but it won’t create additional value. For example, if a firm introduces an inferior product, it won’t shift the industry demand curve. And if the inferior product isn’t priced below its competition, the firm won’t attract new price-conscious customers and increase aggregate production.

New value may be created by forces beyond firms. Changes in macroeconomic conditions, customer tastes, or national demographics can alter industry demand. For example, an aging population and increasing home care for chronic conditions have led to explosive growth in the home-healthcare services industry. In 2024, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projected [17% growth over the next decade](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home-health-aides-and-personal-care-aides.htm). This represents a shift in the demand curve and will increase customer value as firms expand their services.

## Value capture
Customer value can be captured by anyone in the chain of value creation. This includes customers, firms, suppliers, employees, governments, and others. If a firm has a monopoly, its demand curve is also the industry demand curve (see Figure 4). The monopolist’s goal is to maximize profit, so it will set its price at `p*` and production level at quantity `q*`, where ATC is `c*`. The difference between `p*` and `c*` is the firm’s profit per unit. 

The area under the demand curve up to quantity `q*` represents the total value created in the industry. The blue-shaded area is the value captured by the customer. This is called the “consumer surplus.” The green-shaded area is the value captured by the firm, which is the firm’s profit. The red-shaded area is the value captured by suppliers, employees, governments, and others in the value chain. It comprises the firm’s explicit costs (e.g., paying suppliers for raw materials, compensating employees for their labor, paying taxes to governments) and implicit costs (e.g., the implied rate of return expected by shareholders). 

![Figure 4. Value capture](../img/micro-fig-4.png)

### Differentiation
A firm captures value when it differentiates its product from competitors’ products (and customers value the difference). To understand why, consider the opposite⁠—when rival products are identical. In such cases, price is the only factor customers can use to discriminate between products, so customers will naturally choose the lowest-priced product. This pushes prices ever downward. Such pricing pressure is felt by traditional airlines. American, Delta, United, and Alaska all have similar service and safety records, so flyers primarily choose among them based on price. This makes pricing a ruthless game in the industry, with each airline vying to beat its rivals’ prices (yet still turn a profit). 

Differentiation changes the terms of competition. It alleviates some of the downward price pressure because it alters how customers choose between rival products. When a product has brand cachet, unique features, extraordinary quality, or great customer support, customers consider these non-price factors in their purchasing decision. Price alone is insufficient for comparing products. Instead, customers consider the extra value the non-price factors create and adjust their willingness to pay. (This is why differentiation gives a product its own demand curve.) Consequently, a price change may not prompt customers to switch, because non-price factors matter more. This is why Apple could raise the iPhone’s price⁠—from version 7 to 17⁠—by more than $1,000 without hurting demand.

The consequence of differentiation is illustrated in Figure 5. It shows two examples of new entrants entering a monopolist’s market. In Example A, two new entrants introduce products that are nearly identical to the original monopolist’s product, as illustrated by the Venn diagram in the upper right. In Example B, two new entrants introduce products, but the monopolist differentiates its product from the new entrants’ products. Both examples present the original demand curve `d` for the monopolist and the profit-maximizing price `p*` and production level `q*`. The large light-green area depicts the original profit (`[p* − c*] × q*`). However, in both examples, the new competition lowers customers’ willingness to pay and the monopolist’s demand curve shifts left to `d′`. To maximize profit at `d′`, the monopolist lowers production to `q′` and lowers its price to `p′`. Its ATC also increases somewhat to `c′`. The smaller dark-green area depicts the new profit. 

![Figure 5. Introduction of competition](../img/micro-fig-5.png#small)

Although the shifts in demand, price, quantity, and cost all move in the same direction for both examples, the shifts are more severe in Example A. This is because the new entrants’ products are so similar to the monopolist’s. Thus, the monopolist’s demand curve shifts left, potentially until the monopolist earns zero economic profit. But in Example B, the monopolist’s differentiation alleviates the demand curve’s leftward shift. This allows the monopolist to retain higher prices and production.

### Low cost
Even without differentiation, a firm can capture value by lowering average total cost below rivals’ ATC. Depending on how it lowers ATC, a firm may (1) leave the price and quantity the same and simply capture more profit or (2) lower its price and increase production, which brings more price-conscious customers into the market to capture more profit. This is illustrated in Figure 6.

Figure 6 begins with Example A of Figure 5 (where firms sell similar products) and shows how profits improve when ATC falls. Example A of Figure 6 depicts lowered fixed costs, which shift the ATC curve down but don’t affect the curvature. Lowered fixed costs don’t affect marginal costs or revenues, so the profit-maximizing quantity remains `q*`. Profit increases as ATC shifts from `c*` to `c′` while price `p*` and quantity `q*` remain the same. 

Example B depicts the effect of lower variable costs. Lower variable costs flatten the ATC curve, which changes marginal costs too. The firm maximizes profit by lowering its price to `p′` and increasing production to `q′`. This attracts price-conscious customers to the market, and existing customers capture more surplus value because the price is lower.

![Figure 6. Introduction of lower costs](../img/micro-fig-6.png#small)

To capture value from lower ATC, a firm must maintain its low-cost advantage over rivals. If rivals can copy its lower cost, competition will push the demand curve left and profits will disappear. Ultimately, customers will capture the benefits. In contrast, if the firm introduces hard-to-imitate cost savings and lowers its price, rivals won’t follow, lest they incur losses. This insulates the firm from price competition and protects its cost (and profit) advantage.

[^1]. It’s important to note that we’re discussing economic profits, not accounting profits. Accounting profits start with revenues and subtract explicit costs (e.g., labor, depreciation, taxes) but don’t subtract implicit opportunity costs. In contrast, economic profits account for both explicit and implicit costs. The implicit cost is the cost of capital⁠—the return investors expect on the funds they commit to a firm. Thus, accounting profits may be positive even when economic profits are zero.

[^2]. The ideas about value creation and capture are based on [work by Adam Brandenburger and Harborne Stuart](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1430-9134.1996.00005.x), two economists who began applying cooperative game theory to business strategy in the 1990s.
