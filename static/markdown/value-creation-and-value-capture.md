INTELLIGENT STRATEGY builds on the principles of value creation and value capture, which are rooted in microeconomics. This article is a primer on these principles. 

## Industries
Strategy begins with understanding your industry. An industry comprises products or services that serve the same customer need. This means products are _close substitutes_ for each other. In the soft drink industry, an A&W root beer easily substitutes for a Coke or Dr. Pepper, even if a consumer prefers one over the other. And a flight on Frontier Airlines easily substitutes for one on Delta or Alaska, even if the service is worse. 

Your industry’s boundary defines your rivals. Sometimes that boundary is hard to define. For instance, should soft drinks include a Starbucks bottled Frappuccino sold at Safeway? Yes⁠—if customers see bottled coffee and a Coke as close substitutes. And if they do, Starbucks and Coke are rivals, at least for their grocery products. 

Industries sit on a continuum of competitiveness. _Perfectly competitive markets_ are the most competitive. They have many firms selling identical products, and firms are “price takers,” meaning they must accept the market price and cannot influence it. Commodities like sugar or rubber approach perfect competition.

_Monopolies_ have no competition. They consist of only one firm, which sets the industry price. Their dominance pushes governments to regulate them. For example, [PacifiCorp](https://www.pacificorp.com/), a utility, is the sole electricity provider in regions of six Western states. These states require PacifiCorp to seek approval from public utility commissions to raise electricity prices.

At these extremes of the competitive continuum, the scope of potential strategies is restricted. In (near) perfectly competitive markets, firms are limited to efficiency strategies to keep costs low. In monopoly markets, most strategies deal with political and regulatory issues. But in industries between these extremes, firms can choose from a breadth of options.

This middle ground includes industries with _monopolistic competition_ and _oligopolies_. Industries with monopolistic competition have less rivalry and higher barriers to entry than perfectly competitive markets. But they are far from monopolies. Competition is intense and the threat of new entrants is constant. Yet products are different enough to attract distinctive demand, which earns these industries the “monopolistic” moniker. The global apparel and footwear industry is an example. Large brands like Nike, H&M, and Zara, a Spanish retailer, build loyalty and custom demand for their shoes and fast fashion. But they comprise only a small part of the trillion-dollar industry. They can influence prices given their brand power, but their power is curtailed by aggressive rivals. 

Competitiveness in [oligopolies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligopoly) is lower than in industries with monopolistic competition. Oligopolies have a limited number of rivals, high barriers to entry, and a high minimum efficient scale, which pushes firms to become big to run efficiently. The U.S. mobile telecom industry is an example. Three companies⁠—Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T⁠—held 99% of the market share in 2025. With so few rivals, oligopolists can [tacitly collude](https://www.tutor2u.net/economics/reference/oligopoly-tacit-collusion) to raise prices. Parallel price increases that are uncoordinated are legal in the United States, but they can attract scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission or Justice Department, which police anticompetitive practices.

## Customer demand and firm profit
Economists and marketers represent customer demand using a demand curve. A demand curve represents customers’ willingness to pay for a product. To illustrate this point, imagine we sell a fictional garment called a “thneed,” from Dr. Seuss’s [_The Lorax_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNMBVVdrMKo). For simplicity, assume we are a monopolist (we own all known Truffula trees) and can price as we wish. Customers value a thneed differently, so some are willing to pay more than others. 

To create our thneed demand curve, we collected customer data and grouped customers by their willingness to pay, as shown in Figure 1. Four hundred customers will pay $91 for a thneed, another 400 will pay $84 for one, another 400 will pay $77, and so forth. Grouping customers this way reveals the relationship between the price we set and the quantity demanded. No customers will buy a thneed at $100. But 4,000 customers will buy a thneed at $40, and 8,000 customers will buy one at $10.

![Figure 1. Thneed demand curve](../img/micro-fig-1.png#small)

### Maximizing profit
We want to choose a price for our thneed that will maximize economic profit.[^1] (Assume we are not engaged in [price discrimination](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price_discrimination.asp).) Figure 2 illustrates a range of prices and production levels (i.e., quantities) we could choose. The first column shows revenues we could earn. The second column shows costs. And the third column combines revenues and costs to show profits.

Each row presents a slightly different view of revenues, costs, and profits. The first row shows per-unit or average values. The second row shows total values (per-unit values multiplied by the quantity, shown in thousands of dollars). The third row shows marginal or incremental values. Marginal values show how revenue, cost, or profit change when our firm produces one more unit. 

I have chosen three prices and production levels to analyze: $76 at quantity `q_1` = 1,240 thneeds; $18 at `q_2` = 6,670 thneeds; and $49 at `q^{*}` = 3,200 thneeds, which maximizes total profit. 

![Figure 2. Thneed revenue, costs, and profits](../img/micro-fig-2.png#small)

### Revenue (plots 1, 4, 7)
Plot 1 of Figure 2 repeats the demand curve of Figure 1. The shaded area depicts total revenue at `q^{*}`, which is $49 × 3,200 = $156,800. Plot 4 shows total revenue at various production levels. The total revenue at `q_1` is $94,240. This is lower than total revenue at `q^{*}` because the higher price does not compensate for the lower quantity. At `q_2` total revenue is $120,060, which is lower than at `q^{*}` because the higher quantity does not compensate for the lower price.

Plot 7 shows marginal revenues. The marginal revenue (MR) at `q_1` is $55, meaning a production increase from 1,240 to 1,241 thneeds would add $55 to total revenue. At `q_2` MR is −$26 because the revenue from an extra sale does not offset the revenue lost from the lower price. At `q^{*}` MR is $12. This means producing one more thneed would increase revenue⁠—indeed, producing another 800 thneeds would maximize revenue⁠—but it would not increase profit, as detailed later.

### Cost (plots 2, 5, 8)
Plot 5 shows total costs. Total costs consist of fixed costs (the gray horizontal line) and variable costs (the gray upward curve). Fixed costs remain stable regardless of production level, at least in the short term. The fixed cost for our thneed business is $22,000. Variable costs increase as more thneeds are produced, but the rate of increase depends on the baseline production level. Increasing production starting at `q_1` increases variable costs slowly. The added production makes labor more efficient and earns us volume discounts on raw materials. But increasing production starting at `q_2` increases variable costs quickly. Management becomes difficult beyond `q_2`, which raises coordination costs. Total costs follow the curvature of variable costs but are shifted higher to account for fixed costs. The total cost at `q^{*}` is $60,800.

Plot 2 depicts average fixed, variable, and total costs per thneed. Because fixed costs are stable, average fixed costs decrease as production increases. Average variable costs drop initially but rise at higher production levels as coordination costs compound. The average total cost (ATC) is the sum of the average fixed and variable cost. ATC is $34 at `q_1` and drops to $19 at `q^{*}` as we gain economies of scale. ATC rises slightly to $20 at `q_2` as we hit diseconomies of scale. The shaded area captures total cost at `q^{*}`, which is $19 × 3,200 = $60,800, the same as in plot 5. 

Plot 8 shows marginal costs, which are driven solely by variable costs. At `q_1` the marginal cost (MC) of increasing production from 1,240 to 1,241 thneeds is $7. At `q^{*}` the MC of producing one more thneed is $12. 

### Profit (plots 3, 6, 9)
We maximize profit at `q^{*}`, where total revenue less total cost is greatest. This is depicted in plot 6, which combines plots 4 and 5 (total revenues and total costs). At `q^{*}` total revenue is $156,800, total cost is $60,800, and total profit is $156,800 − $60,800 = $96,000. Notice that `q^{*}` is lower than the quantity at which revenue peaks (4,000 thneeds). This is because total revenues level off after `q^{*}` while total costs accelerate, closing the distance between them.

Notice also that in plot 9, MR (blue) equals MC (red) at the profit-maximizing quantity `q^{*}`. In fact, profit is always greatest where MR equals MC. Why? Because marginal revenue and marginal cost represent the slopes of the total revenue and total cost curves (plot 6) at a given production level. When the total revenue curve rises faster than the total cost curve, increasing production expands the distance between total revenue and total cost, which increases profit. But once the cost curve rises faster than the revenue curve, extra production narrows the gap and erodes profit. Thus, profit is greatest when the slopes of the revenue and cost curves match, as shown by the intersection in plot 9 (i.e., when MR = MC).

Plot 3 shows average profits per thneed. Profit is greatest when the production level maximizes the shaded area, which occurs at quantity `q^{*}`. The height of the shaded area is average profit per thneed at `q^{*}`, or $49 − $19 = $30. The width of the shaded area is the quantity, or 3,200 units. Thus, plot 3 also shows that the maximum profit is $30 × 3,200 = $96,000. 

## Value creation
Value creation refers to the aggregate customer value firms create within an industry.[^2] Customer value is determined by customers’ willingness to pay, which is always relative to some alternative: a less-preferred product in the same industry, a substitute product from a separate industry, or simply no purchase at all. For this definition of customer value, only the latter two alternatives apply. 

To explain why, consider a passenger (we’ll call her Kara) who wants to fly to Las Vegas for vacation. Kara’s willingness to pay is the price at which, if fares rise any higher, she won’t purchase a ticket from _any_ airline, choosing either to buy a substitute product (such as a bus ticket) or nothing at all (forgoing the trip). This is the price at which Kara is indifferent about sticking with or leaving the industry and defines the value she derives (for flights to Las Vegas). 

Normally, the price at which a customer will leave the industry is higher than the price at which the customer will switch to a less-preferred product in the same industry. Kara will first look to swap airlines (e.g., from Southwest to Frontier) rather than take a bus or cancel her trip when her preferred airline’s fare rises. Her choice between airlines highlights industry competition, but it masks the full value commercial flight offers her. The full value is the price at which Kara will abandon flying altogether. Thus, customer value is the sum of all customers’ willingness to pay _relative to leaving the industry_.

Figure 3 depicts this aggregate willingness to pay, captured by the industry demand curve `D`. It also depicts quantity `Q`, which is the aggregate production of all firms. The shaded area (a), which is bounded by `D` and `Q`, is the value created in the industry. Created value excludes the area under `D` to the right of `Q`. Firms don’t price their products low enough to bring customers to the right of `Q` into the market, so their value does not materialize. 

![Figure 3. Value creation](../img/micro-fig-3.png#small)

Additional value is created in area (b) when the industry demand curve shifts outward or upward from `D` to `D′` and area (c) when firms increase aggregate production from `Q` to `Q′`. When both `D` and `Q` shift, additional value is created in areas (b), (c), and (d). 

### Firm “added value”
What is the value that any one firm uniquely creates? We can answer this question, at least conceptually, using the “added value” principle: the value created by a firm is the difference in the industry’s value with versus without the firm in it. In other words, a firm’s added value is what would disappear from the industry if the firm vanished.

For example, consider two streaming services, Tubi (owned by Fox Corp.) and Peacock (owned by Comcast), which each streamed 10–15 billion hours of entertainment in 2024. Did they both create the same value that year? Unlikely. Tubi licensed over 99% of its content from others, much of which was available elsewhere. If Tubi suddenly disappeared, customers would simply turn to a different service for the same movies and shows, suggesting Tubi adds very little value to the overall streaming industry. However, if Peacock and its estimated $2.5 billion of exclusive content vanished, fans would complain. (“What happened to _Love Island USA_!?”) The loss of Peacock would put a noticeable dent in the streaming industry’s overall value, which highlights Peacock’s importance. (Of course, the loss of Tubi and Peacock pales by comparison to the hypothetical loss of Netflix, with its $20 billion of exclusive content!)

The added-value principle reveals that value creation must be novel is some way⁠—like introducing a pioneering product feature or innovative manufacturing process. Such actions shift the industry demand curve outward or increase aggregate production (by attracting price-conscious customers to the industry). If a firm only imitates its rivals, it can capture value, but it won’t add to it. For example, if a firm introduces an inferior product, it won’t shift the industry demand curve. And if the product isn’t priced below its competition, the firm won’t attract new price-conscious customers.

New value may be created by forces beyond firms. Changes in macroeconomic conditions, customer tastes, or national demographics can alter industry demand. For example, an aging population and a preference for caring for chronic conditions at home have increased demand for in-home healthcare services. In 2024, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projected [17% growth over the next decade](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/home-health-aides-and-personal-care-aides.htm). This shifts the demand curve outward, prompting in-home healthcare providers to expand their services, which creates more value.

## Value capture
Customer value can be captured by anyone in the chain of value creation. This includes customers, firms, suppliers, employees, governments, and others. Value capture is illustrated in Figure 4, which depicts a monopoly market. The monopolist sets the price at `p^{*}` and production quantity to `q^{*}`, where ATC is `c^{*}`. 

The colored areas in Figure 4 represent the total value created and available for capture. Customers capture the blue area. This is called _consumer surplus_. The firm captures the green area as profit. The height of the green area (the difference between `p^{*}` and `c^{*}`) is the firm’s profit per unit. Others in the value chain⁠—including suppliers, employees, and governments⁠—capture the red area. From the firm’s perspective, the red area represents explicit costs (e.g., paying suppliers for raw materials) and implicit costs (e.g., the implied rate of return expected by shareholders). 

![Figure 4. Value capture](../img/micro-fig-4.png#small)

### Product differentiation
A firm captures value when it differentiates its product from competitors’ products (and customers value the difference). To understand why, consider the opposite⁠⁠—when rival products are identical. In such case, price is the only factor customers can use to discriminate between products, so customers will naturally choose the lowest-priced product. This pushes prices ever downward. Traditional airlines feel this pricing pressure. American, Delta, United, and Alaska all have similar service and safety records, so flyers primarily use price to choose among them. This makes pricing a ruthless game in the industry, with each airline vying to beat its rivals’ prices (yet still turn a profit). 

Differentiation changes the terms of competition. It alleviates some of the downward price pressure because it alters how customers choose between rival products. When a product has brand cachet, unique features, extraordinary quality, or great customer support, customers consider these non-price factors in their purchasing decision. Price alone is insufficient for comparing products. Instead, customers consider the extra value the non-price factors create and adjust their willingness to pay. (This is why differentiation gives a product its own demand curve.) Consequently, a price change may not prompt customers to switch because non-price factors matter more. This is why Apple could raise the iPhone’s price⁠—from version 7 to 17⁠—by more than $1,000 without hurting demand.

The consequence of differentiation is illustrated in Figure 5. It shows two examples of new entrants entering a monopolist’s market. In Example A, two new entrants introduce products that are nearly identical to the original monopolist’s product, depicted by the Venn diagram in the upper right. In Example B, two new entrants introduce products, but the monopolist differentiates its product from the new entrants’ products. Both examples present the original demand curve `d` for the monopolist and the profit-maximizing price `p^{*}` and production level `q^{*}`. The large light-green area depicts the original profit (`[p^{*} − c^{*}] × q^{*}`). However, in both examples, the new competition lowers customers’ willingness to pay and the monopolist’s demand curve shifts left to `d′`. To maximize profit at `d′`, the monopolist lowers production to `q′` and lowers its price to `p′`. Its ATC also increases somewhat to `c′`. The smaller dark-green area depicts the new profit. 

![Figure 5. Introduction of competition](../img/micro-fig-5.png#small)

Although the shifts in demand, price, quantity, and cost all move in the same direction for both examples, the shifts are more severe in Example A. This is because the new entrants’ products are so similar to the monopolist’s. Thus, the monopolist’s demand curve shifts greatly left, potentially until the monopolist earns zero economic profit. But in Example B, the monopolist’s differentiation lessens the demand curve’s leftward shift. This allows the monopolist to retain higher prices and production.

### Low cost
Even without product differentiation, a firm can capture value by lowering average total cost below rivals’ ATC. Depending on how it lowers ATC, a firm may (1) leave the price and quantity the same and simply capture more profit or (2) lower its price and increase production, which brings more price-conscious customers into the market to capture more profit. This is illustrated in Figure 6.

Figure 6 begins with Example A of Figure 5 (where firms sell similar products) and shows how profits improve when ATC falls. Example A of Figure 6 depicts lowered fixed costs, which shift the ATC curve down but don’t affect the curvature. Lowered fixed costs don’t affect marginal costs or revenues, so the profit-maximizing quantity remains `q^{*}`. Profit increases as ATC shifts from `c^{*}` to `c′` while price `p^{*}` and quantity `q^{*}` remain the same. 

Example B depicts the effect of lower variable costs. Lower variable costs flatten the ATC curve, which changes marginal costs too. The firm maximizes profit by lowering its price to `p′` and increasing production to `q′`. This attracts price-conscious customers to the market.

![Figure 6. Introduction of lower costs](../img/micro-fig-6.png#small)

To capture value from lower ATC, a firm must maintain its low-cost advantage over rivals. In other words, it must differentiate on operational efficiency. If rivals can copy its lower cost, competition will push the demand curve left and profits will disappear. Ultimately, customers will capture the benefits. In contrast, if the firm introduces hard-to-imitate cost savings and lowers its price, rivals won’t follow, lest they incur losses. This insulates the firm from price competition and protects its cost (and profit) advantage.

[^1]. It’s important to note that we’re discussing economic profits, not accounting profits. Accounting profits start with revenues and subtract explicit costs (e.g., labor, depreciation, taxes) but don’t subtract implicit opportunity costs. In contrast, economic profits account for both explicit and implicit costs. The implicit cost is the cost of capital⁠—the return investors expect on the funds they commit to a firm. Thus, accounting profits may be positive even when economic profits are zero.

[^2]. The ideas about value creation and capture are based on [work by Adam Brandenburger and Harborne Stuart](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1430-9134.1996.00005.x), two economists who began applying cooperative game theory to business strategy in the 1990s.
