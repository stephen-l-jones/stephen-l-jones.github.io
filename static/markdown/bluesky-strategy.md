Bluesky, a fledgling social media competitor of Elon Musk's X, has experienced surging growth. The site was founded in 2021 and opened its doors to anyone in early 2024. By the end of 2024, it surpassed 25 million users, with much of the growth occuring near the 2024 U.S. presidential election when Musk was championing Donald Trump.

Bluesky was the brainchild of Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter, which Musk acquired and rebranded as X. So it has many similarities to X but also noteable differences. Yet, is it distinctive enough to compete long term with X, which had over 330 million active users at the end of 2024? In other words, is Bluesky a flash in the pan after a contentious presidential election? Or can it grow to be a formidable rival to X?
