Bluesky, a fledgling social media competitor of Elon Musk's X, has surged. It surpassed 25 million users by the end of 2024, less than a year after it opened its doors to everyone. Much of its growth occured near the 2024 U.S. presidential election when Musk was championing Donald Trump.

Bluesky was the brainchild of Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter, which Musk acquired and rebranded as X. Dorsey charged Jay Graber with building Bluesky, and she became its CEO when it was spun out in 2021. 

Bluesky has many similarities to X but also noteable differences. Yet, is it distinctive enough to compete long term with X, which had over 330 million active users at the end of 2024? In other words, is Bluesky a flash in the pan after a contentious presidential election? Or can it grow to be a formidable rival to X?
