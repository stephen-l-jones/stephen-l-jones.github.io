IN 2003, then manager Andy Jassy saw a new opportunity for Amazon: host businesses’ data on a “public cloud” platform so firms do not need to build their own data centers. The idea was simple enough. Building data centers is expensive and is not part of the core competence of most firms. With its scale, Amazon could host its clients’ data at a lower cost. Pricing would be based on use, so small firms could afford the service and scale up quickly if needed. But would firms be willing to give up control of their own data? Would anyone be willing to adopt it? 

It turns out, they would. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is now the largest cloud computing platform in the world, with [32% of the cloud market share](https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/) in 2023. They boast high-profile customers such as [Netflix, Facebook](https://www.contino.io/insights/whos-using-aws), and [the CIA](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2017/11/amazon-web-services-announces-secret-cloud-region-cia/142662/). In 2022, AWS generated nearly $23 billion in operating profit. Andy Jassy became CEO of Amazon in 2021. 

With hindsight, it’s obvious that launching AWS was an excellent decision. But in 2003, it wasn’t so clear. Just two years prior, the dot-com bubble burst, and the most likely entrants had no appetite for offering such a service. (Microsoft, the second-largest player in the industry, didn’t offer their Azure service until seven years later in 2010.) The future was uncertain and the environment was ambiguous. 

But this is not unique. This is the state in which nearly all strategic decisions are made. There is always ambiguity and uncertainty. That’s why strategic decisions are also fraught with failure. While AWS provides a great success story, there are other examples of spectacular strategic blunders, such as [Caterpillar’s poorly-timed production expansion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-caterpillars-big-bet-backfired-1476639360) and the [failed AOL-Time Warner merger](http://fortune.com/2015/01/10/15-years-later-lessons-from-the-failed-aol-time-warner-merger/) or the failed [AT&T-Time Warner merger](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/19/business/media/att-time-warner-deal.html) nearly 20 years later. Because of ambiguity, the successes and failures can be spectacular.

## Uncertainty versus ambiguity
To understand why ambiguity is the bane of strategic decision-making, it’s useful to contrast it with uncertainty. For our purposes, uncertainty means not knowing the outcome before an event but still being able to determine the probability of an outcome. Consider, for instance, a coin toss. It’s not known if the outcome will be heads or tails before the flip, but the probability of getting heads is known to be 50%. 

Ambiguity is more problematic. It means not knowing the outcome or the probability of an outcome. For instance, imagine that someone handed you a coin to flip and said, “By the way, the coin is not fair,” but they didn’t tell you in what way. In such a case, the probability of heads is not 50%. It may be 10% or 75%, but even that is unknown. 

If strategic decisions only included uncertainty, they would be much easier to make. A strategist could weight the likelihood of various outcomes and make a decision based on the most probable outcome. However, ambiguity makes it difficult to predict and weight potential outcomes.

Consider AWS as a real-world example. First, imagine that Andy Jassy only faced uncertainty in 2003 as Amazon was considering whether to build AWS. If this were the case, Jassy would know the probable value of AWS for customers, the probability that potential customers from a set of businesses would convert to actual customers, and the probability that potential competitors from a set of rivals would convert to actual competitors. (There are other probabilities he would need to know too, but this simple example suffices.) Armed with this information, Jassy could estimate quite accurately the likelihood that the new AWS would be profitable.

However, this ideal situation does not match the reality Jassy faced in 2003. He didn’t know concretely what AWS would look like, let alone the value customers would place on it. Because such a service had never been offered, potential customers (even if he could identify them) didn’t know whether they would want to adopt such a service. They could not accurately state the probability of signing up even if Jassy asked. Thus, both customer value and the service offering would need to develop in tandem.

Discerning the probability of rival entrants would be equally difficult. And defining the size and scope of a successful outcome _ex ante_ would be nearly impossible.

### The “right” strategy
The example of AWS highlights the difference between making sense of the past and creating a strategy for the future. It is relatively easy to analyze firms’ prior strategies to understand why their strategies led to superior or inferior performance. But, because of ambiguity, it’s terribly difficult to confidently predict the future performance of firms based on their current strategies.

This reality dictates that there are no “correct” or “right” answers to strategic questions. The future is too ambiguous for that. But there are good strategies that are developed in rigorous ways that have higher probabilities of success than alternative choices. And, in contrast, there are bad strategies that are poorly conceived and are likely to lead to poorer performance.

## How strategists make strategy
Because of ambiguity, strategists need to see the effect of their decisions before they truly know if their decisions were good. This leads to the three-stage strategy-making process shown in Figure 1. Strategists may engage in all three stages at the same time, but they generally iterate through them in order: First, they analyze a business opportunity or threat and choose a course of action. Second, they implement their decisions and execute them over time. Third, they observe the performance effects of their decisions, which may lead to further analysis and decision-making.

### Analyze and make decisions
Rigorous decision-making requires firms to define their performance objectives, generate and evaluate alternatives measured against those objectives, and choose a course of action. 

Businesses make thousands of decisions every day, but they only enter the realm of strategy when the decisions materially impact the firms’ performance or when they affect multiple functions at the same time. Strategic decisions generally answer one of two questions: Which industries should we compete in? And how should we compete in a given industry? Decisions regarding the first question are called corporate strategy, and decisions regarding the second are called business or competitive strategy. 

Corporate strategy includes decisions to acquire other firms, to diversify into new industries, or to vertically integrate upstream or downstream in the supply chain. It also includes, for diversified firms, managing their portfolio of businesses. For instance, to improve its long-term competitiveness and profitability, [Alaska Airlines acquired Virgin America](https://www.wsj.com/articles/alaska-air-closes-virgin-america-acquisition-1481722202) in 2016 for $2.6 billion to become the fifth largest U.S. airline. Economic forces in the airline industry favor consolidation to boost profits, and Alaska saw an opportunity to strengthen its competitive position as a West-coast leader. Further, Virgin America was struggling on its own. Through their strategic analysis, Alaska estimated that the combined company would create $50 million in net cost savings by 2020.
Business strategy includes decisions to position the firm in certain market segments, to launch new products, expand geographically, change pricing, introduce new operational efficiencies, enter a competitor’s market space, or start a new strategic partnership. Business strategies often affect many functions at the same time. For example, Swedish carmaker Volvo [pledged to become carbon neutral](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nargessbanks/2019/10/17/volvo-cars-emissions-plans-xc40-recharge/#7461a31e4447) by 2040 and [launched its first all-electric vehicle](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20915841/volvo-xc40-recharge-electric-suv-specs-miles-range-reveal), the XC40, in 2019. Its ambitious strategy to lower emissions will alter the products it sells, shift its supply chain partners and processes, and bring it into direct competition with Tesla. It also differentiates the company from traditional rivals.

Strategic decisions are often made by top leaders and implemented down through an organization. However, lower-level decision makers can also affect strategy. For instance, many of [Intel’s strategic choices in the 1980s](https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.625) regarding which technologies to invest in were made by middle managers without top management’s direct involvement. This shifted Intel’s strategic direction away from memory and toward microprocessors where it still dominates today. Firms are more likely to push decision-making down into the organization when their industries are evolving too swiftly or when they are too complex to make all strategic decisions at the top.

### Implement decisions
New strategies require firms to change, often in difficult ways. They require buy-in from diverse stakeholders, such as employees, unions, shareholders, and government regulators. And strategies can become suddenly irrelevant by environmental shocks. As firms face competing priorities and difficult realities, [they may not be able to implement their intended strategies](https://doi.org/10.2307/41165263).  

For instance, Boeing has long held a strategic focus on safety, but after two fatal crashes of Boeing’s 737 MAX planes, [U.S. Senators questioned whether safety was truly a priority](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-ceo-muilenburg-gets-through-day-one-of-d-c-hearings-on-the-737-max-mostly-unscathed/). In response to the crashes, Boeing’s board [called for a change in its culture](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/15/business/boeing-safety-737-max.html), and Boeing [reorganized the reporting structure](https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeings-board-to-weigh-engineering-safety-changes-following-737-max-crashes-11568599062) of its top engineers. These changes were made to ensure that its operations fully implemented its strategic focus on safety. 

For Alaska Airlines, closing the Virgin America deal in December 2016 started the long process of implementing its acquisition strategy. Over the [next two years](https://skift.com/2019/01/24/alaska-airlines-works-fast-to-erase-memories-of-virgin-america/), Alaska merged its crews and planes and transitioned all operations to Alaska’s reservation system. Alaska experienced turbulence along the way, requiring it to deal with [employee discontent and increasing operational costs](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/as-alaska-air-cuts-costs-employee-discontent-grows-and-passenger-loyalty-is-at-risk/). Over the course of the integration, Alaska incurred $320 million in special costs and its profitability dropped, as shown in Figure 2. Overall the integration was relatively smooth, but it illustrates the challenge of enacting strategic decisions.

### Observe firm performance
Firms measure their performance mostly with financial indicators, such as sales growth, free cash flow, profit growth, or profitability. But other indicators, such as employee productivity, customer satisfaction, or service quality are valuable as well. Firms also monitor indicators important to society, such as improvements in labor conditions, reduction in carbon emissions, or adoption of sustainable practices. Firms often manage competing performance priorities by using a [balanced scorecard](https://hbr.org/1992/01/the-balanced-scorecard-measures-that-drive-performance-2).

<p id="note-1">Outside analysts normally evaluate performance based on profitability or profit growth. Figure 2 provides an illustration of profitability (top panel) and profit growth (bottom panel) for selected U.S. airlines from 2014–18. Profitability was measured each year using ROIC. Profit growth was measured as the 5-year <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp">compound annual growth rate</a> (CAGR) of the net operating profit after tax (NOPAT).<a href="#end-1"><sup>1</sup></a> Notice that Southwest’s profitability rose from 11% in 2014 to an impressive 30% in 2018. This indicates that for every dollar invested, Southwest returned 30 cents in operating profit in 2018. In contrast, Alaska’s profitability fell from 16% to 13%, with much of its struggle appearing in the years it was integrating its Virgin America acquisition. Also, the profitability of Allegiant Air, a small ultra-low-cost carrier was greater than the profitability of Alaska and United Airlines, both of which are larger rivals.</p>

It is important to note that Allegiant did not earn greater profits than United — United’s profits were 13 times larger than Allegiant’s. But Allegiant’s profitability, which factors in Allegiant’s much smaller capital base, was greater. Also, all four airlines’ profitability was greater than the industry’s average cost of capital, which means all four firms created economic value. The strong profitability reflects the industry’s robust demand over this period. 
The bottom panel of Figure 2 shows that Southwest’s profits grew 28% on average year-over-year, but Alaska’s only grew 10% and United’s only 6%. Strong profit growth and profitability are difficult to achieve at the same time, which makes Southwest’s performance even more impressive.

## Crafting good strategy
Smart strategists follow a systematic, rigorous process to make good decisions in the face of ambiguity. First, strategists articulate the strategic question in a clear, succinct way. Second, they generate potential solutions, or alternatives, to the strategic question. Third, they identify metrics that will help them eventually choose between the alternatives. Fourth, they gather and synthesize data to estimate the metrics. Fifth, they use the analysis to evaluate and choose an alternative. Sixth, they convince leaders to back their strategic recommendation. Each step is detailed below.

### Articulate the strategic question
First, a strategist must clearly articulate the problem to solve, the threat to mitigate, or the opportunity to exploit. The question may be, “What can we do to lower product costs?” “What can we do to neutralize a new entrant?” or “How should we integrate a new technology into our product?” In Jassy’s case the question was, “What kind of public cloud service should Amazon create, if any?” The strategic question may be broad (e.g., “How should we reposition ourselves in the marketplace?”) or narrow (e.g., “Should we make or buy a component part?”). 

It is important to articulate the question because it sets the scope of the analysis and decision, and it frames the possible alternatives. Further, strategic analysis can quickly become unwieldy and get bogged down. If the question is clearly articulated, analysts can return to it to refocus their analysis after they reach obstacles or dead-end tangents. It becomes the overarching guide for the project.

### Generate alternatives to choose from
A strategy, when distilled to its essence, is simply a selected action among alternatives. Thus, one tenet of good strategy-making is to generate a broad set of alternatives to choose from. Creativity and exploration are key here. One common failure of teams is to settle on a candidate solution too quickly. Teams often select the first viable solution they identify and miss better solutions that never get considered later on. When working individually or as a team, it is important to create and protect a period of exploration before favoring one alternative.

Furthermore, strategists can benefit from looking for solutions outside of their industry. Difficult strategic questions may have transferable solutions from other industries that have dealt with similar questions. Good alternatives may be available through [analogical reasoning when done carefully](https://hbr.org/2005/04/how-strategists-really-think-tapping-the-power-of-analogy). For instance, Camp Guernsey is a Wyoming National Guard training facility that had a strategic question of how to productively use its 120 square mile parcel. The base trained artillery and close air support personnel, but its demand was seasonal and it was unused for long stretches of the year. As it searched for solutions, it found that its problem was similar to the problem faced by ski resorts just to their south in Colorado. It studied the ski resorts’ marketing tactics and adopted some of their practices, which attracted new clients such as the Wyoming State Police and the Scouts BSA. Camp Guernsey shows that strategists can search and discover existing alternatives; they don’t always need to create alternatives from a blank slate.

### Identify metrics for selection
Metrics for selection are the criteria used to evaluate the alternatives and select the best one. Metrics may be quantitative, such as market share growth, contribution margin, defect reduction, or profit growth. Or metrics may be qualitative, such as fit with company vision or adherence to corporate values. 
The metrics should be measurable (either qualitatively or quantitatively) and should be the most important criteria for making the strategic decision. For instance, consider Alaska Airlines’ opportunity in 2016 to acquire Virgin America. It had an option to bid for Virgin and an option to let [JetBlue win with its bid](https://seekingalpha.com/article/3960570-is-jetblue-virgin-america-deal-ahead). The question for a strategist in this situation is, “What metrics would sway Alaska toward one alternative or the other?” Potential quantitative metrics could include expected profit growth and returns to shareholders. Good qualitative metrics could include expected competitive strength or brand strength in the U.S. market. 

It is important to choose the selection metrics before analyzing data. For instance, if strategists set profit growth as a metric, they should do so before they create pro forma income statements. The metrics set the direction of data collection and analysis. Without them, the next step in the process can quickly become overwhelming.  

### Gather and synthesize data
The goal of data gathering and synthesis is to calculate the metrics for selection. But ambiguity makes this task difficult. Often data related to the metrics are costly to obtain or simply don’t exist. Synthesis often requires predictions of future events that are sensitive to assumptions and are potentially dubious. For instance, to calculate a profit potential metric, an airline considering an acquisition may want to know the cost to integrate a target firm’s flight attendants. To do so, an analyst needs to estimate productivity declines caused by integrating two different company cultures and processes. But such estimates are highly subjective. This is similar to the situation Jassey likely faced in 2003. He would not have known how many customers would adopt AWS in part because customers could not likely understand the product at that point. Furthermore, multiple inputs normally must be synthesized to calculate a selection metric. Missing data for any one of the inputs can hamper an analyst’s calculations. 

If data gathering is so fraught and difficult, why do analysts attempt to collect and synthesize data at all? The answer is two-fold: (1) some data is better than no data, and (2) analysts can still make rigorous decisions with scarce data. 

Analysts must do the best they can. If data is unavailable they may use proxy information. For instance, if a firm launches a new product, it will lack prior demand information to forecast sales. In lieu of precise data, analysts may use demand information from a related product to estimate the new product’s sales forecast. Or they may speak with multiple experts to build a consensus opinion. At times analysts may lack sufficient data to make acceptable estimates. In such situations, they can make assumptions, i.e., reasonable guesses that are not grounded in concrete data.

Thorough analysts calculate selection metrics using a mix of solid measurements, careful estimates, and loose assumptions. They use the strategic question and selection metrics to guide them. Once the metrics calculated, analysts articulate the uncertainty of the metrics so it is not obscured. They do this by revealing the sensitivity of their calculations to error in measurements or lack of data. This final action adds rigor and credibility to the analysis.

### Evaluate and choose an alternative
Sometimes one alternative rises above the others after the metrics are calculated. In these situations, choosing the best alternative is easy. But other times, two or more alternatives are similar, or one alternative may be better than another depending on what assumptions were used. This makes choosing difficult. 
Considering future options is useful when the choice is hard. Strategists can ask, “If I choose Alternative A, what can I do in the future if A fails? What future options do I have if I choose Alternative B and it fails?” Having future options is valuable, so the alternative with better future options may rise above the others. Strategists can also consider upside (positive) and downside (negative) risks. They can ask, “What is the magnitude of the downside risks of Alternative A versus Alternative B? What is the magnitude of the upside risks of A versus B?” Options with small downside risks and large upside risks are more attractive. Considering future options and upside and downside risks is valuable for any strategic choice, but it is most useful when alternatives are closely comparable.

### Convince others in your organization
Strategic decisions are almost always made by teams, and they frequently involve decision makers with divergent opinions and objectives. The decision-making process can be rancorous. It is not enough to simply arrive at a recommended alternative; good strategies are not adopted on their merits alone. To get adopted, good decisions need persuasive champions who will promote and defend them. 
Successful champions [employ rhetoric](https://blog.ed.ted.com/2017/01/17/rhetoric-101-the-art-of-persuasive-speech/) and [change management principles](https://hbr.org/2008/02/exerting-influence-without-aut) to make strong arguments and convince others they are right. They are more successful when they appeal to their listeners’ head and heart using strong logic and emotional stories. They also build a coalition of supporters to overcome detractors and naysayers. They strategically use their political power and status to move others toward their views. Ultimately, it is the champion's persuasiveness that gets a strategy enacted.

## Now try it

It’s useful to understand the steps to craft good strategy, but the steps will not become truly meaningful until you apply them. Learning to craft good strategy takes practice with real-world strategic questions. A question does not need to be large or complex for the steps to be useful; you can apply the steps to small questions to discover their value. For example, “Which career path should I take?” (this may not seem like a small question to you). So go try it out, and keep these steps handy for your next strategic decision.
