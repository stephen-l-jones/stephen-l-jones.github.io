[Wisk Aero](https://wisk.aero/) wants to take urban transport to the skies. Their electric 4-seat air taxi can take off and land vertically and fly without a human pilot. They plan to offer customers convenient locations to access their air taxis within urban areas. Users will be able to book rides using a mobile app. In 2022, Wisk was acquired by Boeing and began seeking FAA approval. 

Technology, engineering, and regulatory hurdles remain, but as they are overcome, Wisk's dream will become reality. They are hoping to have their service available in Australia [in time for the 2032 Olympics](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wisk-partners-airservices-australia-incorporate-210000920.html). 

The potential of autonomous eVTOL air taxis is exciting, but what is the potential for this new market? Specifically, what is the estimated market size once the current hurdles are overcome? And is Wisk poised to be the leader in it?
