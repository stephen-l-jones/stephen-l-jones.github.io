Netflix is the leader in the streaming video market, but the market has quickly matured and competition has become fierce. In 2022, it experienced its first-ever dip in subscribers, and revenue growth has flattened. Now, it is eyeing a new market to pursue growth: cloud gaming.

So far, Netflix has launched a series of free games on its mobile app. Some are based on hit shows, including _Nailed It!_ and _Stranger Things_. And in 2022, Mike Verdu, VP of gaming, announced that Netflix is [opening its own gaming studio](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/).

The revenue potential for Netflix is huge. The [global gaming market](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16LXrPl71epVKo7VoQqf167LB7AGXFp-WNLpbsETV-v0), at $170 billion, is about five times larger than the global box office. And cloud gaming, while only a fraction of the market currently, is poised for growth.

Yet, there are real risks with entering the market. Cloud gaming, which doesn't require a gaming device or game download, has its [own technical challenges](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-trickybut-potentially-lucrativetask-of-streaming-videogames-1541673000). And Disney and Google have already [tried to enter the market and failed](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-10-24/lat-et-ct-netfllix-games). Plus, dominant players like Microsoft and Sony are already building out their Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus services, respectively.

Should Netflix enter cloud gaming? Why or why not?
