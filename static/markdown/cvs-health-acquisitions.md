In 2023, CVS Health announced its intent to acquire Oak Street HealthLinks to an external site. for $10.5 billion. Oak Street Health is a health provider with 600 primary care physicians in 21 states; it acts as an [Accountable Care Organization](https://www.medicare.gov/manage-your-health/coordinating-your-care/accountable-care-organizations) (ACO) for private and Medicare value-based plans.

Is CVS Health’s move into primary care a smart move? Specifically, will the purchase of Signify Health and Oak Street Health create synergies with CVS Health’s existing network of retail pharmacies, Minute Clinics, pharmacy benefits management, and health insurance? Explain why or why not.
