Grubhub’s [2019 Q3 letter to shareholders](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594109/000156459019038140/grub-ex992_85.htm) rattled investors.  Up to that point, Grubhub had experienced strong growth and profitability. But upstarts DoorDash and Uber Eats — which also offer restaurants marketing, online sales, and delivery services — started eating away Grubhub’s market share. Grubhub revealed a $6 million operating loss in 2019 and merged with Just Each Takeaway (JET), a European peer, in 2020. JET, in turn, [wrote down the value of Grubhub](https://www.wsj.com/articles/grubhub-parent-takes-3-billion-write-down-on-food-ordering-service-11659532196) by €3 billion in 2022.

Even as Grubhub faces intense rivalry, critics of Grubhub and its rivals have accused them of taking advantage of restaurants, charging customers exorbitant fees, and exploiting drivers. This has led New York City, Seattle, Chicago, and other cities to regulate the industry.

Grubhub has taken various steps to turn itself around. It offers free delivery to Grubhub+ subscribers who pay $9.99 per month. And it has partnered with Amazon to offer Grubhub+ free to Prime members for a year. Also, it introduced Perks, which integrates restaurants' loyalty programs into Grubhub. Further, [Grubhub is integrating](https://www.wsj.com/articles/food-delivery-companies-serve-restaurants-better-tech-11563208475) its orders with restaurants' point-of-sale systems and sharing more information with restaurants. 

Are Grubhub's current strategies enough to grow its market share and turn it profitable again? If so, which of Grubhub's efforts are most important to its turnaround and why? If not, what else should Grubhub do and why?
