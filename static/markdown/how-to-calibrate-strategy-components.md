JASON WAS WORRIED about CPA Group, his small certified public accounting firm. He and his partners ran the business profitably and had done so for a long time, but new competitive threats were on the horizon. CPA Group was a tax preparation shop for small business owners and individuals in Jason’s town. But online tax preparation software like TurboTax was siphoning away clients and making it harder to find new ones. Jason constantly felt pressure to lower CPA Group’s prices.

Through conversations with clients, Jason found that they wanted more than just tax services. Often they needed help running their businesses more profitability. Most clients were sole proprietors with little management training. These conversations gave Jason an idea: perhaps CPA Group could expand into small business consulting services. This idea sparked Jason’s thinking further. Is advisory services the best extension for his business? Or should it move into cost accounting, audit, or other services? Could CPA Group really be successful if it expanded beyond tax?

Jason’s experience is not uncommon. Smart entrepreneurs and executives scan their environments continually to identify new opportunities and threats. These efforts can lead to potential new strategies, such as expanding geographically, entering underserved market segments, or dealing with a menacing new rival. But it can be hard to know if choosing a new strategy will improve performance. A new strategy often means broad changes to a firm’s strategy components. And until those changes are understood, it’s difficult to determine if a strategy is viable. 

For example, Jason could offer advisory services, but before jumping in, he should ask a few questions to know if it’s a smart move: Is there enough demand for advisory services in the market? Are there partners who can help generate business? What must CPA Group do to build its advisory capability? Is there enough margin to make the advisory services profitable? How will potential competitors react if CPA Group enters?

Jason’s situation is an example of how firms should think about aligning their strategy components. As discussed in [_The Strategy Components Framework_](./the-strategy-components-framework), enacting a strategy can have cascading consequences: a change in one component can lead to unexpected changes in others. For example, if CPA Group offers advisory services, it changes the firm’s product component. But that one change might also require changes in the customer, partner, operations, finance, and competitor components too. In other words, for Jason’s new strategy to work, CPA Group’s strategy components must be calibrated with each other and with the broader environment.

To achieve superior performance, strategists need a systematic way to calibrate their strategy components when they face new opportunities and threats. This third article in the strategy components series provides guidance on how to do so.

## Strategy components calibration
There are four simple guidelines to calibrate strategy components, as shown in Figure 1. The guidelines are broad so they can apply to many business types and a variety of scenarios. Entrepreneurs can use them to design new ventures. Small businesses owners can use them to analyze their firms’ performance potential. And corporate strategists can use them to exploit opportunities or defend against threats. 

First, begin with the most salient strategy component. Second, visit strategies in every strategy component. Third, look for new options created by strategic choices. Fourth, try many paths. The theory is simple, and the rest of this paper illustrates how to apply it successfully.  

### Begin with the most salient strategy component
[General Electric was floundering](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ge-powered-the-american-centurythen-it-burned-out-11544796010) in 2019. Its free cash flow and market value had crashed. It fired its CEO, Michael Flannery, after only 14 months and then hired board member and Danaher CEO, Larry Culp. With the company’s future existence in question, Culp began a company-wide [review of how to fix its operations](https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-expected-larry-culp-to-break-apart-ge-instead-hes-trying-to-fix-it-11570460349). 

In a very different situation, spurred by very different events, leaders of the Idaho-based [Continuous Composites](https://www.continuouscomposites.com/) were concerned about how to grow their startup. The small firm had developed patented technologies for carbon fiber 3D printing, but it was uncertain where its technologies were most valued. It had potential to gain market share in a composite industrial goods industry. For example, it could make carbon fiber airplane wings, which were currently manufactured using expensive [autoclaving processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoclave_(industrial)). Or it could improve existing 3D-printed products that were made with unreinforced plastics. 

The events that spur action naturally point to which strategy component to begin with. In GE’s case, it began with its finance component by analyzing its various business’s profitability. This analysis pointed to problems with its operations and customer contracts. In the case of Continuous Composites, it had a viable product that was in search of customers who would want to use it. So its analysis began with the customer component. And Jason of CPA Group began with the competitor component. When he recognized that his online competitors were much more powerful, he looked for ways to diversify his services.

An R&D breakthrough may prompt you to start with your firm’s product component. The failure of a supplier may lead you to reconsider your firm’s partner component first. Or if your firm recently acquired a rival, you may begin with your firm’s operations component. 

### Visit strategies in every strategy component
Strategies are interdependent, so it’s important to review each strategy component to determine how initial choices affect all components. For example, if Jason chose to offer advisory services, he would need to:
- Review the operations component to design new job roles and determine what training the CPA Group’s employees would need to build their advisory capability.
- Review the customer component to determine who to target with its new services.
- Visit the partner component to determine whether existing lead finders can help him build the new business.
- Review the competitor component to determine how local competitors might respond to CPA Group’s move.
- Visit the finance component to determine how profitable the service line extension can be.

Decisions made in one strategy component often constrain available alternatives in another. Constraints can be so severe that no good alternatives remain. For example, if Jason reviewed the operations component, he could decide to build a strong advisory capability. But after doing so, he might not find a way to make those services profitable. When he visits the customer and finance components, he might find that customers’ willingness to pay is too low and the costs of aggressive hiring and training is too high to earn a profit. So he might need to rethink his earlier decision in the operations component and find a more cost-effective way to build the advisory capability.

If you don’t visit every strategy component, you run the risk of missing constraints. Novice entrepreneurs, for instance, tend to ignore the competitor component. They often identify their customer segments and detail their product offering but fail to ask the question, “How will potential competitors respond if my product succeeds?” That question might reveal that their value proposition has very little protection from large incumbents. There may be no viable path to success with their current value proposition. They may have to rework their value proposition until they can devise barriers to entry or first-mover advantages.

### Look for new options created by strategic choices
Not all strategic decisions lead to greater constraints. Some decisions lead to new options. For example, the decision to build a new capability in the operations component may lead to new product options. Or cash management strategies in the finance component may free up capital and create new operations investment options. 

Such options may go unnoticed or be unavailable until you have reviewed some of your firm’s strategy components. For example, entrepreneurs might not realize the variety of ways they can build out their operations until they settle on their partner strategies. 

At other times, new options may only be detected after a firm enacts its component strategies. For example, Continuous Composites may discover potential partners that offer complements, but only after it begins selling in a specific industry. Or CPA Group may find another service extension after it starts using its advisory capability.

### Try many paths
Because of constraints and interdependencies, it’s likely that you will fail to calibrate your strategy components effectively on the first try. Decisions in one component may lead to dead ends in other components. Product ideas may have market segments that are too small. Capabilities may be too costly to build. Partner strategies may lead to the loss of core capabilities. These dead ends should be expected. Persistence is needed, and uncommon variations can be fruitful. 

Entrepreneurs naturally start with the value proposition (product and customer components). But they may find it difficult to calibrate these components. In this case, they could start over and build their business around the competitor component. By starting with competitors, entrepreneurs could look for niche segments that are underserved. From there, they might discover a new value proposition that is similar to their initial idea but better protects them from competition.

This same idea could be adopted to design product line extensions. For example, if Jason finds that advisory services are a poor option for CPA Group, he may review his firm’s core capabilities and consider how they can be used to extend further into existing markets.

The main idea is that each new pathway drawn through the strategy components can lead to new insights and to a viable business. You should approach the challenge from multiple perspectives and various starting points. Even after the components are calibrated, you can continue to look for better options as time and resources allow.

## Common calibration patterns
There are many patterns you can follow to calibrate strategy components, but there are a few patterns that firms commonly use. This is because many firms face similar business events, such as changes in customer markets, poor financial performance, or new competitive threats. Four of the most common patterns are customer-focused, finance-focused, competitor focused, or resource-focused calibration.

### Customer-focused calibration
Customer-focused calibration starts with customer research, as shown in Figure 2. This research identifies existing and emerging market segments using customer demographics, psychographics, or other attributes. It also identifies each segment’s size and preferences for product functions and features. You can use this analysis to determine which customer segments to target, which products to offer, and how to position the products in the market. These choices define a firm’s value proposition.

Once you have defined the value proposition, identify your firm’s direct competitors in each market segment. These two pieces of the strategy components framework — the value proposition and the direct competitors — allow the firm’s marketing function to estimate demand curves for the firm’s products.

At the same time, you can determine the capabilities that are needed to offer the desired products. This may include building distribution channels, acquiring engineering resources and manufacturing capacity, or developing customer service talent. These capabilities may exist within the firm’s internal operations or be leveraged through partner relationships. Once you understand your firm’s needed capabilities, you can estimate your products’ cost curves. 

Armed with the firm’s estimated demand and cost curves, you can determine product prices and quantities that can maximize their profit potential. Revenue and profit estimates are captured in pro forma income statements, and estimated capital needs are captured in pro forma balance sheets and cash flow statements.

Using this calibration pattern, you traverse all six strategy components. 

If the firm’s estimated profit margins are poor, you may reevaluate your decisions by adjusting which market segments to target or adjusting their product mix or positioning strategies. These changes ripple through the other design decisions and ultimately modify the firm’s estimated profit. You may conduct multiple iterations until you find the right combination of strategies that can drive the firm’s profit goals.

### Finance-focused calibration
When a firm’s performance is poor, its leaders will often use the firm’s financial results to identify ways to reduce costs, increase revenues, or both. Finance-focused calibration begins with analysis of the firm’s revenues, costs, and cash flow, as shown in Figure 3. If the firm’s revenues are too low, analyze the firm's value proposition. If the firm’s costs are too high, analyze the firm’s capabilities. 

While analyzing the firm’s value proposition, you may bolster the firm’s products by repositioning or enhancing them, or cut products in underperforming market segments. You may also enter new market segments to increase scale and sales. If a firm leaves or enters a market segment, its direct competitors will change, and any changes to its direct competitors or its value proposition will affect its products’ demand curves.

To reduce the costs of its capabilities, you may attempt to adjust the firm’s internal operations or its partner strategies without sacrificing product quality. To increase efficiency internally, you may enact improvement programs (e.g., Lean, Six Sigma, total quality management). Or you might adopt company-wide culture initiatives or improve hiring practices. To improve partner efficiencies, you may increase knowledge sharing and tightly integrate workflows. You might also outsource or insource activities depending on the relative costs of making or buying inputs. These changes can lower the products’ cost curves.

When analyzing capabilities, consider changes to the firm’s value proposition. Such changes may increase or decrease the need for capabilities, which may affect the firm’s cost structure. 

The reverse is also true: when analyzing the value proposition, consider changes to the firm’s capabilities. Changes in capabilities may improve or hamper the quality of the firm’s products, which may affect the products’ demand curves.

Once the firm’s demand and cost curves are updated, you can determine product prices and quantities and estimate the firm’s pro forma statements, including new revenue and profit projections. If you are not satisfied with the pro forma estimates, you may reanalyze the firm’s value proposition or its capabilities and costs. You may iterate through this calibration pattern until the firm’s pro forma statements reveal the improvements you expect.

### Competitor-focused calibration
You may adopt a competitor focus when the firm is losing market share to rivals, competition is fierce, or new entrants change the dynamics of the industry. In such cases, first identify the firm’s current and potential competitors in the industry, as shown in Figure 4. Then benchmark the competitors’ value propositions and capabilities against your own. The goal is to understand where competitors are strong and well positioned relative to your firm’s strength and position.

After analyzing rivals, you may rethink your firm’s value proposition, capabilities, or both. Your firm may exit a market segment where a dominant competitor is entrenched and a frontal attack would be too costly. You may preemptively enter a market segment to deter a rival’s entry. Or you may reposition a product to differentiate it from a rival’s product.

You can also focus on capabilities. Through benchmarking efforts, you may spot inferior capabilities in your firm and adopt strategies to bolster them. Or you may recognize a particularly valuable capability and design ways to exploit it more. 
Competitor-focused calibration may emphasize changes to the value proposition or capabilities. Just as in finance-focused designs, here too you must account for changes to capabilities when designing the value proposition and changes to the value proposition when determining capabilities. The two are interdependent. 

Once you determine the changes to value proposition and capabilities, you can estimate demand and cost curves, determine pricing and quantities, and develop pro forma statements. If the pro forma statements are unsatisfactory, you may revisit the value proposition or capabilities.

### Resource-focused calibration
The resource-based view[^1] argues that a firm’s resources (assets and capabilities) lead to competitive advantage. But not all resources are competitively advantageous. Advantageous resources must be rare and difficult or costly to imitate; otherwise, they will not differentiate a firm from its rivals.

Resource-focused calibration begins with the firm’s operations and partner components, as shown in Figure 5. First, analyze the firm’s internal operations to identify valuable resources — those that are particularly good at lowering cost or increasing value. Then analyze the firm’s partnerships to identify relational resources[^2] that lower cost or increase value. Also analyze your rivals' resources to know how rare they are. And determine how difficult or costly it is for rivals to mimic your firm’s resources. 

Once you have identified your firm’s valuable, rare, and inimitable resources (both internal and relational), devise ways to leverage them better. For example, if a product design team is particularly good, they may be given greater authority or be tasked with developing more design talent to exploit the design capability further. Or, if an R&D partner is especially resourceful, the firm and its partner may expand the scope of the partnership to exploit the R&D capability. 

You may also identify capabilities that are lacking but are important to obtain competitive advantage. The firm may change its hiring strategy to bolster an important team. Or the firm may signal its willingness to cooperate to build strategic partnerships. 

The expansion and development of capabilities affect a firm’s costs, so when you determine the firm’s capabilities, you can also update the firm’s cost curves. 

Additionally, the firm can adjust its target segments, product mix, and products’ positioning to capitalize on its updated capabilities. For example, a firm with a strong product innovation capability may expand its product offering to better exploit its capability. Once you have updated the firm’s value proposition, you can estimate the products’ demand curves. 

With the demand and cost curve estimates, you can set product prices and quantities, and you can estimate revenues, profits, and capital needs. You may also revisit operations and partner strategies if the capability changes are too costly or do not deliver sufficient value.

### Commonalities among calibration patterns
Figures 2 through 5 show commonalities across the calibration patterns. First, every pattern touches a firm’s value proposition and strategies to develop and enhance the firm’s capabilities, both internal and relational. The value proposition and capabilities are two core pieces of any business, and they affect each other. Customer-focused calibration puts emphasis on the firm’s value proposition and adjusts the capabilities afterward. In contrast, resource-focused calibration puts emphasis on the firm’s capabilities and later adjusts the value proposition. Finance-focused and competitor-focused calibrations address a firm’s value proposition and capabilities concurrently.

Second, every calibration ultimately affects a firm’s financial performance. This is because superior performance — normally based on some profit measure — is a firm’s ultimate objective. If a firm’s strategy components calibration does not lead to increased profit potential, then more effort is required.

### Strategy components evolution and revolution
It is important to recognize the state of an industry when designing strategy components. Strategists need to determine whether their industry is experiencing a period of incremental change or a sudden disruptive discontinuity. As discussed in [_Strategy Components and Environmental Conditions_](./strategy-components-and-environmental-conditions), industries may progress incrementally for many years, even decades, and then new technologies may arise that lead to radical product improvements. Then, after a period of uncertainty, the industry settles again into incremental change.

The calibration patterns outlined above work best during stable industry periods. Firms can adapt their existing strategy components to deal with incremental changes to competitive threats, customer preferences, or technologies. But in a moment of discontinuous transformation, a simple evolution of strategy components can be dangerous. Often, discontinuities limit the potential to fit together viable strategy components similar to existing ones. Eastman Kodak failed because it stuck with its traditional business after digital cameras and smartphones disrupted the photography industry. Kodak’s chemical knowledge and film processing capabilities lost their value in the digital age. No amount of tinkering with strategy components would have solved the problem because most customers no longer valued its products. 

Times of discontinuity must be managed differently. Strategists must build strategy components from scratch without the constraints of older versions. New strategies must not be rejected simply because their profit formula looks different. (The poor margins for digital cameras looked unpalatable to Kodak when compared to its large margins on film.) Discontinuous change ushers in new economic realities that require fresh thinking about how profits are made, unburdened by old assumptions. 

Kodak, with its digital capabilities, could have continued to develop [CCD and CMOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MytCfECfqWc) technologies and licensed them to others, or perhaps manufactured digital camera components for others. (Sony and Omnivision now supply cameras to Apple for its iPhone.) Or it could have expanded into new industries, such as medical products like Fuji did. Such moves would have required Kodak to revolutionize its value proposition, dump its chemical capabilities, or recognize radical new ways to earn profits as a technology licensor, component supplier, or medical products provider — all of which would have required a fresh start with its strategy components. 

WHETHER YOUR COMPANY is like CPA Group or GE, strategy components calibration will help you choose a complementary suite of strategies. And the calibration process can spark new ideas as well as expose dead-end alternatives. By using the process, you won’t be left with a clouded sense of your firm’s strategic fit. You’ll gain a panoramic view that shows how your strategy components lead to superior performance.
