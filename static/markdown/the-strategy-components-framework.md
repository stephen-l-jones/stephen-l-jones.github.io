NO SINGLE STRATEGY makes a firm successful. But it is tempting to believe that myth. Pundits point to one strategy or another to tell compelling stories about a firm’s success. Apple, for example, is said to have a competitive advantage because of its industrial design team, the late Steve Jobs’ imprint on the company, or its brand strength. Any one of these explanations sounds appealing, but each is inadequate by itself. No firm achieves superior performance through a single strategy. 

In reality, a firm’s competitive advantage is based on many past decisions and current strategies that combine to create a compelling whole. Dominant firms craft strategies for their supply chain, internal operations, and market position that fit seamlessly together. It is the smart combination of many individual but connected choices that allows a firm like Apple to reduce costs, expand markets, and create customer value better than rivals.

Apple uses a broad differentiation strategy to target consumers and avoid price-conscious market segments. It exploits world-class product innovation and design capabilities to deliver aesthetically appealing personal tech. It pairs its innovation and design with excellent marketing to carefully craft its brand image. Because of the quality of its products and its brand strength, Apple can sell millions of devices at higher prices than most competitors. Part of Apple’s quality is based on its ecosystem strategy: watches, iPads, iPhones, MacBooks, and apps all work seamlessly together across operating systems (watchOS, iPadOS, iOS, and macOS). This adds customer value and makes it costly for customers to switch to rivals. Allowing third-party developers to deploy apps in its App Store further increases the value of Apple’s products. Apple does all of this while partnering with strategic suppliers like Foxconn, which lowers Apple’s manufacturing costs and allows it to scale production quickly. This suite of strategies and capabilities generate tremendous profit for Apple. Its net income topped $94 billion in 2021.

It’s easy to look back on Apple’s performance and identify its suite of successful strategies. But it’s much harder as a strategist to choose and combine strategies to create future success. Because firms have so many activities to manage and decisions to make, the challenge of getting them to work in concert with each other can be overwhelming. When your firm faces new opportunities or threats, it's natural to ask: How should I determine which parts of my business need to change? How do I know if my strategic choices will fit together? How do I know if my decisions are comprehensive? 

This three-part series on strategy components will help answer these questions. This first article introduces the strategy components framework and the principles of strategic fit. The [second article](./strategy-components-and-environmental-conditions) explains how environmental conditions affect strategy components. And the [third article](./how-to-calibrate-strategy-components) teaches how to calibrate strategy components. 

The strategy components framework (described in this article) organizes strategies into core domains. These core domains, called strategy components, are the fundamental areas of business strategy. The framework helps strategists think holistically and ensure that their firm’s strategies work in concert with each other. It highlights the ramifications of certain choices and points out roadblocks. It prods decision-makers to think more carefully and to consider creative combinations that can lead to superior performance. The framework aids strategists, not by telling them what to do or by substituting for innovative thinking, but by helping them shape creative ideas into a comprehensive business plan. In essence, it helps strategists combine good individual strategies to make them all great together. 

The strategy components framework is related to the concept of business models. The exact definition of a business model is difficult to pin down. Some have defined it as a [good story](https://hbr.org/2002/05/why-business-models-matter) about how a firm works or simply as a narrative description of the firm. Others say a business model is a system of interconnected activities that “[determines the way the company ‘does business’](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/creating-value-through-business-model-innovation/).” Whether it’s a story or an activity system, a business model is intended to be a comprehensive representation of the firm. One difficulty with using business models to set strategy is they lack structure. Strategists are simply told to create a sensible narrative of what the business does, which is an unhelpful prescription for strategic planning. Or strategists are shown example [diagrams with complex combinations of boxes and arrows](https://hbr.org/2011/01/how-to-design-a-winning-business-model%20) representing a different firm’s choices and consequences, but the diagrams are difficult to translate to one’s own firm or situation. 

The strategy components framework adopts the comprehensive nature of business models. But the framework makes it easier to grasp a firm’s many choices by dividing them into strategy components (described in this article), connecting the components to a firm’s environmental conditions (described in the second article), and providing guidance on how to determine whether strategies fit together (described in the third article). 

## The strategy components framework
All businesses face common challenges that compel them to answer the same set of questions. Who will we serve? How will we serve them? How should we operate? Who should we cooperate with? How do we compete? And how will we generate profits? The answers to these six questions constitute the strategy components in the framework shown in Figure 1. 

Each component addresses a different facet of a firm’s knowledge, strategies, and capabilities. The product, finance, and operations components encapsulate a firm’s internal strategies and capabilities. The customer, competitor, and partner components encapsulate a firm’s knowledge of and relations with external entities. The customer and product components combined create a firm’s value proposition. And the operations and partner components together encapsulate the capabilities a firm can leverage.

Each component captures key knowledge, strategies, and capabilities. Together, the strategy components provide structure and clarity about a firm that a traditional business model does not provide. The following sections look at each component.

### Customer component
The customer component answers the question, “Who are our customers and what do they value?” It is the component that captures customers’ needs, desires, and values. It maps the industry’s market segments and pinpoints the firm’s target segments. It holds a trove of insights about market demand and customer behaviors.

Spirit Airlines, for example, prides itself on knowing what ultra-price- sensitive flyers are willing to give up for lower ticket prices. Those outside its target segment might find its service level [appalling](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1-d8729157-r727810863-Spirit_Airlines-World.html) or [unethical](https://review.chicagobooth.edu/magazine/summer-2015/why-spirit-airlines-is-so-terrible), but Spirit knows which consumers will be lured back to its pied piper-like low fares. Its steady focus on the ultra-low-cost segment steers all of its strategies.

Netflix, in contrast, wants everyone in the world to sign up for its service. And yet Netflix is just as focused on knowing its customers as Spirit, if not more so. Netflix [tracks nearly every user action](https://neilpatel.com/blog/how-netflix-uses-analytics/) on its site. It sifts through its vast trove of customer data to serve up personalized front screens and to choose which original projects to fund. The originals are tailored to [please specific customer niches](http://theconversation.com/the-unique-strategy-netflix-deployed-to-reach-90-million-worldwide-subscribers-74885) that Netflix identifies using its customer intelligence.

### Product component
The product component includes a product’s design, aesthetic, service, features, and positioning in the marketplace. For high-tech products, it includes the technology roadmap and product lifecycle. It also includes the sales channels to reach customers, how customers interact with the brand, and what the customer’s buying experience is like. 

For the Ritz-Carlton, a luxury hotel chain, its foremost product feature is how it serves its customers. Its employees greet guests by name with genuine smiles before escorting them to their opulent rooms. All employees are known as brand ambassadors, and the Ritz-Carlton’s [Gold Standards](https://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/about/gold-standards) encourage them to fulfill “even the unexpressed wishes and needs of our guests.” The Ritz even gave employees specific scripts to ensure that guests had pleasant exchanges with staff. But when the scripts made conversations too robotic, it [dropped the scripts](https://www.forbes.com/sites/micahsolomon/2015/09/24/your-customer-service-style-is-your-brand-the-ritz-carlton-case-study/#2c1f6f3d55ef) and taught employees how to personalize exchanges to make them warm and authentic.

Combined, the customer and product components define a firm’s value proposition. The two components together describe how product offerings fulfill customers’ wants or, colloquially, “[jobs to be done](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done).” Alignment between products and jobs to be done creates customer value. Netflix creates value because it knows what its customers prefer without requiring them to expend any effort to say what they want. And then it presents a personalized selection of movies and shows on their screens. For Spirit, its low fares and à la carte pricing create value for customers who otherwise might drive or take the bus. It opens up air travel to a new class of flyers. The Ritz-Carlton offers wealthy guests value by giving them an immersive luxury experience.

### Finance component
The finance component includes how a business generates profits and how it will address its capital needs. The firm’s profit formula translates its value proposition into revenue projections and its capabilities into cost projections. The finance component also includes how a firm taps capital markets to raise cash and how the firm manages day-to-day working capital.

For example, Netflix’s profit formula is based on acquiring millions of new subscribers each year and slowly raising subscription prices. As it scales, Netflix acquires more content, which increases the value of the service to each subscriber. By the end of 2019, it had $24.5 billion in streaming content available, which was close to the value of Disney’s entire library. It also had another $11.8 billion in content contracted to go live over the next five years. Netflix pays fees to license other studios’ content and pays directors, actors, and engineers to produce its own originals. It also has large marketing and engineering costs. Because most of its costs are fixed, the more subscribers Netflix acquires, the more profitable it will be.

But there is a lag between when Netflix pays for licensed content and when the content generates revenues. The lag for its own original content is even longer. This leads to a discrepancy between profits and free cash flow: while Netflix made $2.6 billion in operating profit in 2019, it had a _negative_ [free cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freecashflow.asp) of $3.3 billion. This means Netflix has a voracious appetite for cash to fuel its content binge. Netflix primarily uses debt markets to raise cash. By the end of 2019, it had amassed $20.7 billion in debt (primarily corporate bonds) and paid over $600 million in interest for the year. Thus, an important strategy in Netflix’s finance component is how it monitors subscription revenues and content costs and issues bonds to cover the difference. 

### Operations component
The operations component answers the question, “What capabilities do we need in order to realize our product?” A firm can only deliver on its promised product if its internal capabilities are up to the task. And capabilities generate costs as they are employed, so they must be as efficient as possible to keep costs low.

A firm’s capabilities are housed in its functions — marketing, sales, engineering, production, human resources, etc. — and its management structure. They include technical capabilities (such as designing a smartphone) and management capabilities (such as creating a culture of accountability). To succeed, a firm needs technical capabilities focused on its products and management capabilities focused on operating effectively.

Zappos, an online retailer of shoes and apparel (and an Amazon subsidiary), has developed customer support capabilities to offer a one-of-a-kind experience. It is fanatical about creating a “personalized emotional connection” (or PEC) with each customer that calls. It sets no time limit on how long reps can speak with customers. Instead, its employees celebrate its longest call ever — over ten hours — and the story is central to the company’s lore. Employees have also spontaneously sent flowers to bereaved callers and [sent pizzas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mknIg_Abfw), when asked by flight attendants, to a cohort of new JetBlue hires. To create this level of service, Zappos developed management capabilities to smartly hire and train employees. It is very careful to select the right candidates, and to make sure they are committed, it [offers them $2,000](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2008-09-16/why-zappos-offers-new-hires-2-000-to-quitbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice) to quit after they are hired. It has also created a zany culture that encourages self-expression and a decentralized management structure called holacracy, which attempts to foster innovation and speed up decision making. Combined, these capabilities help Zappos be the Ritz-Carlton of customer support. 

### Partner component
Businesses cannot succeed in isolation. They rely on partners’ capabilities because a business cannot develop all the capabilities it needs on its own. The partner component includes a firm’s relationships with its partners and how the relationship helps the firm’s operations.

Some strategic partners are suppliers, resellers, or contractors. For example, Avon depends on its 5 million independent contractors to sell its cosmetics. It is a pioneer in multilevel marketing in which women earn commissions as they sell products and earn a bit more if they convince friends to become contractors too. By using representatives instead of building internal distribution, Avon drastically lowers its capital requirements and pushes many of the risks inherent in sales onto its reps. The same is true for Uber. It lowers its costs by hiring gig workers to do the driving. It considers itself a technology platform company, not a taxi service. 

Firms can also ally with rivals in their industries through joint ventures and industry consortia. For example, engineers from Qualcomm, Huawei, Nokia, and many other telecom firms work together to set mobile communications standards in a global consortium called [3GPP](https://www.3gpp.org/). It is the governing body that created the 4G and 5G protocols used in smartphones. As new needs arise, member firms submit contributions that are voted on by consortium members and adopted into the standards. The worldwide governing body has fueled the advancement of mobile communications since the turn of the century.

Partners can also be municipalities or government agencies. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is the U.S. agency that certifies aircraft, and it is an important Boeing partner. Boeing is dependent on the FAA to get any new aircraft off the ground. After two fatal crashes, the FAA grounded all of Boeing’s 737 MAX airplanes in March 2019, leading to a $1 billion loss in the fourth quarter of that year. Boeing fixed its planes, and the FAA gave its approval to fly again after a 20-month hiatus.

The operations and partner components contain the set of internal and external capabilities a firm can exploit. They determine whether the firm can realize its value proposition. They also drive a firm’s cost structure. Firms must balance building internal capabilities with seeking out external partners.[^1] The more a firm builds capabilities internally, the less it needs to rely on partners, and the more it relies on partners, the leaner it is internally.

### Competitor component
The competitor component answers the question, “How do we handle a rival’s competitive threats?” It examines how rivals compete with a firm and how they may react to a firm’s strategic moves. It also includes potential rivals who might enter the industry in the future.

A firm develops strategies based on its analysis of its rivals. For example, a firm often predicts rivals' reactions to its price signals in the market. A low-cost leader will at times advertise a guarantee to match any competitor’s price. This type of promotion warns rivals that the cost leader will lower its price if they try to price below it. The low-cost leader can use this strategy if it expects rivals will catch the signal and keep their prices up. 

A firm also predicts the competitive moves of new entrants. For example, cereal makers General Mills and Kellogg’s have learned to protect their market share by looking for untapped segments that potential rivals might enter. To combat this new entry threat, they keep a close eye on cereal trends and make sure they have a product for every consumer taste. When Kellogg’s noticed a consumer desire for cereals that support a healthy gut, it released [HI! Happy Inside](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielknoebel/2018/11/20/kelloggs-new-cereal-has-your-insides-in-mind/#34db138e1d69). The 2018 product launch promoted the cereal’s fiber, probiotics, and prebiotics. By quickly filling the new niche, Kellogg’s made sure new entrants could not exploit the open space in the market.

### A comprehensive example: Apple’s strategy components
Consider the strategy components for Apple in Figure 2. Apple’s customer component describes Apple’s targeting strategies. Apple targets consumers across the world who want easy-to-use, beautiful, status-oriented personal devices, and it avoids price-conscious consumers. Its customer strategies complement its product, positioning, and price strategies. Apple creates sophisticated, aesthetically-appealing devices that work seamlessly together. It also offers an endless variety of apps developed by third parties. It prices high and avoids discounting in order to maintain its perception of quality. The customer and product components together show how Apple creates value.

Apple’s operations component includes the core capabilities and strategies it uses to support its value proposition. Apple invests heavily in its design and marketing capabilities to create beautiful personal devices. It also fosters an innovative culture to continually release new features and enhanced devices. But Apple doesn’t try to do everything itself. Apple’s partner component includes how it leverages the capabilities of others. Apple relies on the manufacturing prowess of suppliers and the creativity of third-party app developers. Apple could build these capabilities in house, but by leveraging partners’ capabilities, it can focus on its core strengths.

Apple’s competitor component includes how Apple competes with its rivals. Apple protects against customer defections by increasing switching costs. Its integrated ecosystem and focus on brand loyalty make it difficult for customers to leave Apple. To compete, Apple also releases high-quality, well-designed personal technologies, but it does not try to be the first in the market (i.e., the bleeding edge). For example, Blackberry sold personal digital assistants with full keyboards well before Apple introduced the iPhone. Microsoft introduced a tablet PC before Apple’s iPad, but Microsoft’s tablet failed to catch on. Apple accelerated the growth in both of these markets by refining the technologies and thereby capturing mass audiences, even though they were not the first to release such products.

Apple’s finance component includes how its strategies generate profits and utilize cash. Apple captures as much value as it can through its pricing, and it reduces costs through economies of scale. This creates large profits and strong cash flows. A portion of this cash is reinvested into innovation projects and its portfolio of products.

This brief look at Apple’s components provides insight into Apple’s competitive advantage. Note that none of the strategies by themselves creates Apple’s success. It is Apple’s integration of the strategies into a compelling whole that is important. 

Also, it is not enough to know Apple’s strategy components to replicate its success. The components are only a representation of Apple’s actual business. Describing Apple’s suite of strategies is far easier than executing all of them. But knowing how strategies work together is vital. Strategists who understand how strategy components fit together are better equipped to make good decisions.

## Strategic fit
Netflix released the political drama [_House of Cards_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvSkxBYuoQY) in 2013 and began its competitive foray into originals, rewriting the media sector’s rule book. Prior to House of Cards, media production and delivery were split. Major studios like Disney, Warner Bros., and Viacom produced premium content. And multichannel video programming distributors ([MVPDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multichannel_television_in_the_United_States)) such as Comcast and Dish delivered it to U.S. households. When Netflix began streaming in 2007, its internet distribution followed a similar model to the MVPDs: Netflix licensed movies and TV shows from studios using fixed-fee contracts and exclusive streaming rights. Video on demand via the internet was novel, and it did not yet challenge the major studios and distributors. 

So why did Netflix choose to upend the industry structure by producing its own originals? The answer lies in the fit of its strategy components. 

Strategy components do more than simply categorize strategies. They highlight the strategies’ connections and offer insights into how strategies might be refined. These concepts are highlighted by the principle of interdependence and the principle of options and constraints.

### Principle of interdependence
Business strategies don’t exist in a vacuum. Strategic choices can have wide-reaching effects, and choices in one strategy component often influence choices in another. In this way, strategy components are interdependent. For example, the customer segments that a firm targets will affect its product mix in the product component. This in turn affects the capabilities it develops in its operations component. For example, if G6 Hospitality, the owner of the Motel 6 brand, decided to target upscale travelers, it would need to create a hotel brand with nicer furnishing and amenities than Motel 6, and it would need to develop a capability to pamper its guests.

Further, a firm's internally-developed capabilities affect its choice of who to partner with. For example, Starbucks sees bean roasting as a core capability, so it doesn’t need to partner with major roasters like Folgers Coffee. But Starbucks lacks a grocery distribution capability, so it partners with Nestle to distribute its ground coffee and single-serve cups, and it partners with Pepsico to distribute its ready-to-drink coffees. 

Additionally, customer targeting strategies define the firm’s competitors. And those competitors influence the firms’ profit potential in the finance component. For example, Delta, United, and other traditional airlines now also target ultra- price-conscious flyers. But by doing so, they compete directly with Spirit, which has a much lower cost structure and lower fares. To stay competitive, Delta prices its basic economy fare below its cost and hopes to entice customers to [upgrade to a regular economy ticket](https://skift.com/2017/10/12/basic-economy-is-more-of-a-defensive-product-for-delta-air-lines/). 

In similar ways, interdependencies drove Netflix to produce original shows. When Netflix first launched its streaming service, its strategy components fit well. But things soon changed. Netflix was collecting data on its streaming site about every aspect of its customers’ interactions. It learned how to analyze this data to gain deep knowledge of its customers’ viewing interests. With its expert knowledge, it began to micro-target its customers with series and movies it knew its customers would love. And this is where Netflix’s business model became an obstacle. 

Netflix was reliant on studios for content, but the studios lacked the deep customer intelligence that Netflix possessed. The studios didn’t produce all of the targeted content that Netflix knew its customers wanted. Netflix could have shared its insights with its studio partners, but its knowledge was too valuable to simply give away. Instead, Netflix decided to produce its own content to exploit its valuable customer intelligence. 

Netflix knew the studios would perceive this strategic shift as a direct attack. From the studios’ point of view, Netflix had become a streaming behemoth. Netflix had over 44 million streaming subscribers by the end of 2013 and was adding a few million more every quarter. Its increasing size was giving Netflix ever-greater bargaining power in licensing negotiations. Netflix knew of the studios’ fears, so it knew it needed to start creating original shows quickly. In other words, it had to build its production capabilities before the studios could build their own streaming distribution capabilities and curtail Netflix’s bargaining power. 

Netflix’s entry into original productions illustrates the interdependence of its strategy components (see Figure 3). Netflix’s strategies in the operations, customer, product, partner, competitor, and finance components all affect one another.

And there’s one more interdependency not yet covered. Netflix’s move into originals came with a steep price tag. When licensing content from other studios, Netflix pays a fee when the content launches on its site. But, as mentioned above, Netflix has to pay directors, actors, producers, and engineers for its original productions years before the content launches. Netflix’s pivot to originals exacerbated Netflix’s need for cash, which was already acute because of its rapid growth. 

Its new and growing library of original shows increased its subscription numbers and revenues. But competition from new streaming outlets limited its ability to raise prices. Greater revenues would lead to greater cash availability, but its production appetite appears insatiable. Original shows now consume all of Netflix’s organic cash flow and more. And its ability to grow its content is dependent on accessing new capital, primarily debt. Netflix entered a tricky cycle of issuing debt to cover its content growth, which drove its subscriber growth, which made it possible to meet its debt obligations. 

### Principle of options and constraints
Netflix’s example highlights another principle: because strategy components are interdependent, strategic choices in one component create options or constraints in others. Fundamentally, a strategy is an option selected from a set of alternatives. And alternatives in one strategy component tend to limit or expand the alternatives in other components. 

For example, a firm might have the option to target price-conscious consumers or quality-focused consumers. At the same time, the firm might have the option to produce a product with inexpensive or high-quality materials. The option to target price-conscious consumers aligns with the inexpensive product alternative. And the option to target quality-focused consumers aligns with the quality product alternative. If the firm chooses to target high-quality consumers, the option to produce an inexpensive product becomes less feasible. The firm will need to produce the high-quality product to fit with the targeted consumers’ desires.

In the operations component a firm might have the option to develop its own manufacturing capability or to use a partner’s manufacturing capability. The choice to develop its own manufacturing capacity might lead to the discovery of new product alternatives that were not known before, whereas relying on a partner’s capability would not lead to expanded product possibilities.

In Netflix’s case, it built a customer intelligence capability as part of its operations component, which created new options in its customer and product components (learning what movies and shows each niche audience liked). In other words, its strategic choice in the operations component expanded its value proposition alternatives.

In contrast, Netflix’s choice to produce originals constrained its partnering opportunities and increased competitive threats. New rivals entered the U.S. market soon after Netflix began releasing originals: CBS launched All Access in 2014. Apple launched Apple TV+ and Disney launched Disney+ in 2019. AT&T launched HBO Max and Comcast launched Peacock in 2020. These new entrants escalate competitive pressures, which could force Netflix to delay planned U.S. price increases so that it keeps subscriber growth on track. A price hold could dampen its profit growth and constrain or eliminate some financing alternatives. Lower revenues and less cash could constrain its product strategy by diminishing the rate or quality of its productions. 

The principle of options and constraints highlights the need for strategists to consider their strategies’ effects across strategy components. If strategy components are developed in isolation, strategists run the risk of unwittingly cutting off viable strategies and the firm’s future success. 

DON’T BELIEVE the myth that leading firms build their success on a single strategy. Firms gain competitive advantage through a full suite of strategies masterfully fit together. But it’s difficult to know how to combine strategies from all parts of a business. That’s why the strategy components framework is important. It gives strategists a holistic way to think about their business. Strategists who use the framework and ideas described in the strategy components series can turn their firm’s haphazard strategies into a unified force driving their firm toward superior performance.

[^1]. There is a rich economics and strategy literature on the choice to build capabilities internally vs. relying on partners’ capabilities. Economists call this the “make-or-buy decision.” Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson argued in his [transaction cost economics theory](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2393356.pdf) that firms will “buy” (i.e., rely on partners) when the partners don’t need to invest too much in assets that are specific to the relationship (e.g., machines, software, human capital). However, firms won’t find a willing partner if the partner is required to invest in specific assets (i.e., assets that can only be used to create products for the firm). Partners don’t want to invest in specific assets because those assets lose their value if the partnership collapses. Therefore, if significant specific investments are necessary, the firm must build capabilities internally. Economists Oliver Hart and John Moore disagreed somewhat in their [property rights theory](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2937753.pdf). They argued that firms can still work with partners when asset-specific investments are needed, but it requires some inventive contracting and ownership juggling. The firm that wants a partner to make asset-specific investments can own the specific asset but let the partner use it. For example, a firm could own a specialized machine but let a partner operate it at the partner’s plant.
