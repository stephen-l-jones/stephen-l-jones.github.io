[HOKA](https://www.hoka.com/en/us/) means "to fly" in the Maori language. The name is fitting. Its founders Nicolas Mermoud and Jean-Luc Diard designed its running shoes to help runners fly faster downhill. Its shoes, first introduced in 2009, maximized cushioning and stability with minimal weight, leading to a unique profile that became a buzz in running circles. In 2023, it became a billion dollar brand.

HOKA's success in the running category is impressive given the dominance of well-known brands like Nike and Adidas. Further, HOKA, which was purchased in 2013 by Ugg and Teva owner Deckers Outdoor, has continued to grow even as other running upstarts like [On](https://www.on.com/en-us/) and [Altra Running](https://www.altrarunning.com/) have increased their market share. 

What has led to Hoka's success and can it continue? Specifically, what targeting and positioning strategies did it adopt to penetrate a crowded running category? And can it continue to expand its reach in running or in other footwear categories?
