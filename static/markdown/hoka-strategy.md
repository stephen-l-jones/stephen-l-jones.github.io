[HOKA](https://www.hoka.com/), meaning "to fly" in the Maori language, was founded in 2009 by Nicolas Mermoud and Jean-Luc Diard. Their aim was to help runners fly faster downhill. They worked to maximize cushioning and stability with minimal weight. This led to shoes with a unique profile. HOKA was purchased in 2013 by Deckers Outdoor, owner of Ugg and Teva. In 2023, it became a billion dollar brand.

HOKA's success in the premium running category is impressive given the dominance of well-known brands like Nike and Adidas. Further, HOKA has continued to grow even as other running upstarts like [On](https://www.on.com/en-us/) and [Altra Running](https://www.altrarunning.com/) have increased their market share. 

What has led to Hoka's success? Specifically, how did it penetrate a crowed market and how has it positioned itself relative to its competitors? In what ways has it differentiated itself? In what was has it imitated its competitors?
