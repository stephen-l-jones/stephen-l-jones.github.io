COSTCO IS the world’s third-largest retailer. Since its founding in Seattle in 1983, the company has mastered the membership-club model, selling bulk quantities at steep discounts. Today it operates more than 900 warehouses serving 145m cardholders worldwide. Despite razor-thin margins, Costco has grown revenue and profit year after year while earning a reputation for customer loyalty and employee satisfaction. Yet its approach seems counterintuitive. It caps markups, pays workers well above industry standards, and has a product range of just 3,700 SKUs⁠—compared with tens of thousands at traditional retailers. How does Costco succeed while defying retail convention?

Profitability analysis helps answer that question. It reveals when strategies work and why, and suggests how to improve those that falter. The insights come from digging into financial statements to uncover the effects of business decisions.

Profitability analysis differs from other forms of financial-statement analysis. An investment banker scrutinizes financial statements to estimate enterprise value, often ahead of an acquisition. An investor does much the same when deciding whether to buy or sell shares. A strategist, by contrast, analyzes profitability to improve performance. The goal is to increase a firm’s value, not merely calculate it.

This article explains how to analyze profitability: which ratios matter, how to calculate them, and how to link them to strategic decisions.

## Profitability as return on invested capital
Return on invested capital (ROIC) captures a firm’s financial performance. It measures how well a company transforms capital into profit. An ROIC of 20% means that for every dollar invested, a firm generates 20 cents in profit from operations.

ROIC belongs to a family of profitability measures including return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA). This article focuses on ROIC alone. In theory, it captures profit-generating efficiency better than any other measure.

ROIC focuses on operating decisions, which affect core activities such as manufacturing, marketing, and management. These contrast with financing decisions, which concern where to invest excess cash and whether to raise capital through debt or equity. By focusing exclusively on operations, ROIC expresses profitability regardless of how a firm is funded.

### Return on invested capital (ROIC) calculation
ROIC draws on income-statement and balance-sheet items. As a non-standard measure, it requires judgment. (This article presents a common formula, but not the only one.) The calculation is complicated because financial statements reflect both operating and financing decisions. To isolate operating decisions, the calculation excludes or adjusts numbers affected by financing.

ROIC is the ratio of *net operating profit after tax* (NOPAT) to average *invested capital* (IC). NOPAT measures profit generated by operating decisions; IC measures the debt and equity a firm employs. The formula for year `t` is: 
```
\text{ROIC}_t = \frac{\text{NOPAT}_t}{\text{average IC}_t} = \frac{\text{NOPAT}_t}{(\text{IC}_t + \text{IC}_{t-1})/2}
```
For example, Costco’s NOPAT in the fiscal year ended August 2025 was $7.8bn, and its IC at the end of fiscal 2025 and 2024 was $36.1bn and $33.8bn, respectively. So Costco’s ROIC for 2025 was:
```
\begin{aligned}
  \text{Costco ROIC}_{2025} &= \frac{\text{NOPAT}_{2025}}{(\text{IC}_{2025} + \text{IC}_{2024})/2} \\
                            &= \frac{\$7.8\text{bn}}{(\$36.1\text{bn} + \$33.8\text{bn})/2} \\
                            &= \frac{\$7.8\text{bn}}{\$35.0\text{bn}} \\
                            &= 22.3\%
\end{aligned}
```
For every dollar invested, Costco generated 22.3 cents in profit from operations.

### Net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) calculation
NOPAT, the ROIC numerator, is calculated from income-statement items. (Financial-statement items appear in ``underlined monospace``.) The formula for year `t` is:
```
\text{NOPAT}_t = \text{operating profit}_t-\text{adjusted taxes}_t
```
*Operating profit* often appears as ``operating income`` or ``earnings before interest and taxes`` (EBIT) on the income statement.[^1] It excludes items related to financing decisions, such as ``interest expense`` or ``non-operating income and expenses``.

Operating profit excludes income taxes, yet taxes reflect operating decisions and must be accounted for. But simply subtracting taxes from operating profit creates a problem. In America, a company’s tax bill falls when it takes on debt, because interest is deductible. This means financing decisions affect taxes: debt-financed firms pay less.[^2] To account for this, NOPAT uses adjusted taxes, calculated from a firm’s effective tax rate.[^3] Adjusted taxes for year `t` are:
```
\begin{aligned}
  \text{adjusted taxes}_t &= \text{operating profit}_t\times\text{effective tax rate}_t \\ 
                          &= \text{operating profit}_t\times\frac{\text{provision for taxes}_t}{\text{earnings before taxes}_t}  
\end{aligned}
```
Both ``provision for taxes`` and ``earnings before taxes`` (not to be confused with EBIT) are income-statement items. The NOPAT formula for year `t` can thus be rewritten using only income-statement items:
```
\begin{aligned}
  \text{NOPAT}_t &= \text{operating profit}_t-\text{adjusted taxes}_t \\
                 &= \text{operating profit}_t-\text{operating profit}_t\times\frac{\text{provision for taxes}_t}{\text{earnings before taxes}_t} \\
                 &= \text{operating profit}_t\times\left(1-\frac{\text{provision for taxes}_t}{\text{earnings before taxes}_t}\right)        
\end{aligned}
```
Costco’s 2025 NOPAT of $7.8bn is derived from its income statement as follows:
```
\begin{aligned}
  \text{Costco  NOPAT}_{2025} &= \text{operating profit}_{2025}\times\left(1-\frac{\text{provision for taxes}_{2025}}{\text{earnings before taxes}_{2025}}\right) \\ 
                              &= \$10.4\text{bn}\times\left(1-\frac{\$2.7\text{bn}}{\$10.8\text{bn}}\right) \\
                              &= \$10.4\text{bn}\times\left(1-0.25\right) \\
                              &= \$7.8\text{bn}
\end{aligned}
```
Costco’s effective tax rate was 25%.

### Invested capital (IC) calculation
IC is the ROIC denominator and is calculated using balance-sheet items, starting with ``total assets``. The IC formula at the end of year `t` is:[^4] 
```
\text{IC}_t = \text{total assets}_t-\text{NIBCLs}_t-\text{excess cash}_t
```
NIBCLs stands for *non-interest-bearing current liabilities*. They are current liabilities (due within one year) that have no implied or express rate of return. (In contrast, interest-bearing current liabilities earn a return. For example, the ``current portion of long-term debt`` earns interest.) NIBCLs include items such as ``accounts payable``, ``taxes payable``, ``unearned revenue``, ``accrued wages payable``, and other accrued liabilities. They represent capital from suppliers, governments, customers, and employees that is briefly held by the firm.

NIBCLs can constitute a large portion of a firm’s capital base. Costco’s NIBCLs were $36.7bn in 2025, constituting 48% of its total assets. Of that, $27.7bn was accounts payable owed to suppliers. But suppliers are not Costco investors; they don’t earn a return by letting Costco hold money owed to them. Thus, accounts payable and other NIBCLs aren’t considered “invested” capital and are subtracted from total assets in the IC formula.

*Excess cash* is cash that is not employed in a firm’s operations. For example, at the end of 2025, Apple held $132bn of ``cash`` and [``marketable securities``](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketablesecurities.asp) (which are liquid like cash). But Apple uses only a small fraction of that cash in its day-to-day operations. Most of it sits in accounts earning a return. Since excess cash is not being used, it is subtracted from total assets in the IC formula.

While conceptually clear, excess cash is difficult to quantify because it is not a balance-sheet item. So a heuristic is used to estimate it. A firm normally needs cash [equal to 2% to 5% of annual sales](https://www.shareholderforum.com/returns/Library/20140604_Mauboussin-Callahan.pdf) to run its daily operations. Cash held beyond that is excess.[^5] A stable firm in a stable industry might only need cash equal to 2% of sales. A growing firm in a volatile industry might need cash equal to 5% of sales (or more).

At the end of 2025, Costco held $15.3bn in cash and short-term investments, and 2025 sales were $275.2bn. Assuming Costco needed cash equal to 4% of sales, its 2025 cash need was $275.2bn × 0.04 = $11.0bn. Thus, Costco held $15.3bn − $11.0bn = $4.3bn in excess cash.[^6] At the end of 2024, Costco had $1.0bn in excess cash. Costco’s average IC in 2025 was:

|  Costco (in billions) |    2025   |    2024   | Average   |
|:----------------------|----------:|----------:|----------:|
|  Total assets         |   $77.1   |   $69.8   |   $73.5   |
|  Less: NIBCLs         |   $36.7   |   $35.0   |   $35.9   |
|  Less: Excess cash    |    $4.3   |    $1.0   |    $2.7   |
| **Invested capital**  | **$36.1** | **$33.8** | **$35.0** |

These IC numbers were used to calculate Costco’s ROIC above.

### An alternative IC calculation
Total assets can be separated into three kinds of assets: (1) current assets, (2) property, plant, and equipment (PPE), and (3) other assets. Current assets is the ``total current assets`` balance-sheet item. PPE is the ``net property, plant, and equipment`` balance-sheet item.[^7] And other assets includes all other long-term assets on the balance sheet, such as ``goodwill`` and ``intangible assets``.

Current assets is used to calculate a firm’s net working capital (NWC). For the purposes of profitability analysis, NWC at the end of year `t` is:
```
\text{NWC}_t = \text{current assets}_t-\text{NIBCLs}_t-\text{excess cash}_t
```
This is a non-standard formula for NWC. (Usually it is calculated as current assets less current liabilities.) But we use this formulation because it answers the question, “How much invested capital is needed to run the firm’s day-to-day operations?” A lower NWC suggests that a firm can operate primarily on the “free” financing NIBCLs provide. Indeed, a negative NWC benefits a firm: it indicates that the firm’s NIBCLs fully meet its short-term capital needs, with some free financing to spare. 

Costco had current assets of $38.4bn and $34.3bn at the end of 2025 and 2024, respectively, so its NWC was:
```
\begin{aligned}
  \text{Costco NWC}_{2025} &= \$38.4\text{bn}-\$36.7\text{bn}-\$4.3\text{bn} = \text{−\$2.6bn} \\
  \text{Costco NWC}_{2024} &= \$34.3\text{bn}-\$35.0\text{bn}-\$1.0\text{bn} = \text{−\$1.7bn}
\end{aligned}
```
Costco sells its goods before suppliers’ invoices become due. And it collects annual membership fees (as unearned revenue) when members join or renew. In this way, Costco’s suppliers and members finance Costco’s day-to-day operations interest-free.

Starting with NWC instead of ``total assets``, the IC at the end of year `t` is calculated as:
```
\text{IC}_t = \text{NWC}_t+\text{PPE}_t+\text{other assets}_t
```
This alternative formula yields the same result for Costco’s average IC in 2025:

|  Costco (in billions)            |    2025   |    2024   | Average   |
|:---------------------------------|----------:|----------:|----------:|
|  Net working capital             |   −$2.6   |   −$1.7   |   −$2.1   |
|  Net PPE + operating leases[^7]  |   $34.6   |   $31.6   |   $33.1   |
|  Other assets                    |    $4.1   |    $3.9   |    $4.0   |
| **Invested capital**             | **$36.1** | **$33.8** | **$35.0** |

## Benchmarking ROIC
ROIC must be compared to a benchmark to be useful. Three common benchmarks are:

1. A competitor’s ROIC.
2. A firm’s historical ROIC.
3. The average ROIC in a firm’s industry.

Walmart is a suitable benchmark for Costco, as both companies are large U.S.-based grocery and general merchandise retailers. Walmart’s ROIC in 2025 was 13.8%. So Costco, with an ROIC of 22.3%, earned 8.5 cents more than Walmart for every dollar invested. This reveals that Costco is highly profitable, besting the world’s largest retailer. 

Costco’s success came from steady improvement over time, as shown in Figure 1. Its ROIC in 2025 was nearly double its 11.4% ROIC in 2012. In contrast, Walmart’s ROIC dipped and then recovered over the same period.

![Figure 1. Costco v. Walmart](../img/costco-v-walmart.png#small)

Costco’s ROIC also beat the industry average in grocery and general merchandise, which, combined, was an estimated 13.8% in 2025. These benchmarks show that Costco is a superior performer.

### ROIC and economic value creation
A positive ROIC does not ensure that a firm is creating economic value. If a firm fails to match its cost of capital, it actually destroys value.[^8] For example, Skullcandy, a [headphones maker rooted in extreme sports](https://www.skullcandy.com), destroyed value for investors before [going private](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/10/03/876636/0/en/Skullcandy-Closes-Going-Private-Transaction-with-Mill-Road-Capital.html). It was profitable with an ROIC of 4.6%, but fell short of its cost of capital of 7.2%. In other words, investors weren’t earning the return they expected given the risk they were taking. They would have been better served investing their capital elsewhere.
 
## Going deeper: Return on sales and capital turnover
ROIC tells *if* a firm is profitable, but it doesn’t explain *why*. That requires deeper analysis, as shown in Figure 2. The first step is to separate ROIC into two additional ratios: return on sales and capital turnover. The two ratios give different explanations for a firm’s profitability.

![Figure 2. Profitability analysis ratios](../img/profitability-ratios.png#small)

### Return on sales
Return on sales measures a firm’s operating efficiency. It is the percentage of revenue that becomes profit after subtracting operating costs. Firms that control their costs earn a higher return on sales.

Return on sales has the same numerator as ROIC and the denominator is sales or ``total revenue``:
```
\text{return on sales}_t = \frac{\text{NOPAT}_t}{\text{sales}_t}
```
Costco’s ``total revenue`` in 2025 was $275.2bn, so its return on sales was:
```
\text{Costco return on sales}_{2025} = \frac{\$7.8\text{bn}}{\$275.2\text{bn}} = 2.8\% 
```
This means Costco turned 2.8 cents of every sales dollar into profit.

### Capital turnover
Capital turnover measures a firm’s capital efficiency. It captures the amount of revenue generated for each dollar of invested capital, expressed as a dollar amount. Firms that generate more revenue from a given capital base will have a higher capital turnover.

Capital turnover’s numerator is sales and denominator is average IC, the same as ROIC:
```
\text{capital turnover}_t = \frac{\text{sales}_t}{\text{average IC}_t}
```
Costco’s capital turnover in 2025 was:
```
\text{Costco capital turnover}_{2025} = \frac{\$275.2\text{bn}}{\$35.0\text{bn}} = \$7.86 
```
This means Costco generated $7.86 of revenue for every dollar invested.

### Relationship with return on invested capital
Return on sales and capital turnover directly relate to ROIC:
```
\text{ROIC}_t = \text{return on sales}_t \times \text{capital turnover}_t
```
Expanding the return on sales and capital turnover ratios shows why this relationship holds:
```
\text{ROIC}_t = \frac{\text{NOPAT}_t}{\text{sales}_t} \times \frac{\text{sales}_t}{\text{average IC}_t} = \frac{\text{NOPAT}_t}{\text{average IC}_t}
```
Increasing either return on sales or capital turnover will increase ROIC. For example, if a firm lowers its material costs to increase its operating efficiency, it will increase its return on sales and ROIC. Or if a firm uses its manufacturing plants more productively to increase its capital efficiency, it will increase its capital turnover and ROIC. 

A firm with a negative return on sales will have a negative ROIC; raising capital turnover without improving margins will only make matters worse. Such a firm must address its operating inefficiencies first.

### Benchmarking operating and capital efficiency
Return on sales and capital turnover are benchmarked the same way as ROIC. These benchmarks offer the first insight into why a firm’s ROIC is good or poor. If a firm’s return on sales diverges from the benchmark return on sales, then operating efficiency⁠—and the strategies that drive it⁠—help explain the firm’s better or worse profitability. Likewise, if a firm’s capital turnover diverges from the benchmark capital turnover, then capital efficiency and the associated strategies explain the profitability difference.

Costco was more profitable than Walmart owing to superior capital efficiency. Costco’s capital turnover in 2025 dwarfed Walmart’s: $7.86 versus $4.32. Operating efficiency doesn’t explain Costco’s higher ROIC because Costco’s return on sales was lower than Walmart’s: 2.8% for Costco compared to 3.2% for Walmart. (I explain later what drives Costco’s capital efficiency.)

## Going even deeper: Expense, asset, and unit-based ratios
Deeper analysis reveals why a firm’s operating or capital efficiency is good or poor. Expense ratios calculated from income-statement items give operating efficiency insights. And asset ratios calculated from balance-sheet items give capital efficiency insights (see Figure 2). 

Expense and asset ratios vary by industry. For example, airlines report fuel expenses, but movie studios don’t. On the other hand, movie studios report content assets, which airlines don’t have. Thus, this deeper analysis requires industry-specific knowledge, including knowing how assets are used and why different expenses exist.

### Expense ratios
Expense ratios explain why a firm’s operating efficiency is good or poor. An expense ratio is calculated by dividing an operating expense⁠—such as ``cost of goods sold`` (COGS) or ``selling, general, and administrative`` (SG&A) expense⁠—by sales. A lower expense ratio indicates greater operating efficiency. In the retail sector, common ratios include “COGS over sales” and “SG&A over sales”.

Expense ratios directly relate to return on sales. If an expense ratio increases, then return on sales will decrease, and vice versa. This is shown by expanding the return on sales formula:
```
\begin{aligned}
  \text{return on sales}_t &= \frac{\text{NOPAT}_t}{\text{sales}_t} \\
                           &= \frac{\text{operating profit}_t - \text{adjusted taxes}_t}{\text{sales}_t}
\end{aligned}
```
Then, recognizing the components of operating profit for the retail sector, we can rewrite return on sales as:
```
\begin{aligned}
  \text{return on sales}_t &= \frac{\left(\text{sales}_t - \text{COGS}_t - \text{SG\&A}_t\right) - \text{adjusted taxes}_t}{\text{sales}_t} \\
                           &= \frac{\text{sales}_t}{\text{sales}_t} - \frac{\text{COGS}_t}{\text{sales}_t} - \frac{\text{SG\&A}_t}{\text{sales}_t} - \frac{\text{adjusted taxes}_t}{\text{sales}_t} \\
                           &= 1 - \left(\frac{\text{COGS}_t}{\text{sales}_t} + \frac{\text{SG\&A}_t}{\text{sales}_t} + \frac{\text{adjusted taxes}_t}{\text{sales}_t}\right)
\end{aligned}
```
Costco’s adjusted taxes over sales was 0.9% in 2025. Combined with its COGS over sales (87.2%) and SG&A over sales (9.1%), return on sales can be expressed as:
```
\text{Costco return on sales}_{2025} = 1 - \left(87.2\% + 9.1\% + 0.9\%\right) = 2.8\%
```
This formulation shows why increasing expense ratios decrease return on sales.

### Asset ratios
Asset ratios explain why a firm’s capital efficiency is good or poor. An asset ratio is calculated by dividing a balance-sheet asset by sales. A lower asset ratio indicates greater capital efficiency. In the retail sector, common ratios include “average NWC over sales” and “average PPE over sales”. 

Asset ratios affect capital turnover the same way that expense ratios affect return on sales. An increasing asset ratio decreases capital turnover, and vice versa. This is shown by inverting the capital turnover formula and expanding average IC:
```
\begin{aligned}
  \text{capital turnover}_t &= \frac{\text{sales}_t}{\text{average IC}_t} \\
                            &= \left(\frac{\text{average IC}_t}{\text{sales}_t}\right)^{-1} \\
                            &= \left(\frac{\text{average NWC}_t + \text{average PPE}_t + \text{average other assets}_t}{\text{sales}_t}\right)^{-1} \\
                            &= \left(\frac{\text{average NWC}_t}{\text{sales}_t} + \frac{\text{average PPE}_t}{\text{sales}_t} + \frac{\text{average other assets}_t}{\text{sales}_t}\right)^{-1}
\end{aligned}
```
Costco’s average other assets over sales was 1.5% in 2025. Combined with its average NWC over sales (−0.8%) and average PPE over sales (12.0%), Costco’s capital turnover can be expressed as:
```
\text{Costco capital turnover}_{2025} = (−0.8\%+12.0\%+1.5\%)^{-1} = \$7.86
```
This formulation shows why increasing asset ratios decrease capital turnover.

### Unit-based ratios
The ratios introduced so far have been dollar-denominated, meaning they either have sales dollars or invested capital dollars as the denominator. But it is also helpful to denominate ratios in sales units or asset units. For example, in the airline industry, operating efficiency is often expressed as cost per available seat mile (CASM). It is calculated by dividing an airline’s operating costs by the number of miles every seat in every plane traveled in a year⁠—regardless of whether a passenger flew in the seat. It reveals when expenses are rising relative to demand. In retail, capital efficiency is often expressed as revenue per store or revenue per square foot. These ratios monitor how well a retailer’s footprint is generating revenue.

Unit-based ratios complement dollar-denominated ratios. Which unit ratios to calculate depends on the industry being analyzed.

## Analyzing profitability
Profitability analysis begins at the top of Figure 2 and works downward, exploring branches where a firm’s ratios diverge from the benchmark. Diverging ratios may suggest an important strategic or operational difference. A poor ratio may indicate a failing strategy. A strong ratio may indicate a competitive advantage. However, it is easy to misinterpret diverging ratios, so a thorough understanding of the firm⁠—its strategy, decisions, and operations⁠—is essential.

I’ll illustrate how to analyze profitability by briefly examining Costco in 2025, using Walmart as a benchmark.

### Costco vs. Walmart
Costco’s profitability in 2025 was strong relative to Walmart’s, as shown in Figure 3. Costco’s ROIC was 22.3% compared to Walmart’s ROIC of 13.8%. 

![Figure 3. Profitability analysis: Costco v. Walmart, FY 2025](../img/profitability-costco-v-walmart.png#small)

Costco’s profitability was stronger because of its superior capital efficiency. Costco’s capital turnover was $7.86 compared to Walmart’s $4.32. Costco’s return on sales was lower, so its operating efficiency doesn’t explain its higher profitability.

Drilling deeper shows why Costco’s capital efficiency was higher. Costco’s average PPE over sales was lower than Walmart’s: 12.0% vs. 19.8%. (A lower asset ratio is better.) This reveals that Costco uses less retail space to generate each dollar of sales. Revenue per square foot highlights the difference: Costco generated $2,039 per square foot of retail space, whereas Walmart generated only $647. Costco is much better at using its warehouses to generate revenue.

On the other hand, Costco’s working capital doesn’t explain its higher profitability. Costco’s average NWC over sales was −0.8% compared to Walmart’s −2.3%. Walmart’s ratio is lower, which suggests Walmart manages its working capital better. (Walmart has a larger surplus of interest-free capital to cover day-to-day operations.)

Why is Costco better at generating revenue from its retail footprint? First, Costco sells in bulk quantities, which gives it greater revenue per customer visit. So a busy Costco will generate more revenue than a busy Walmart. 

Second, Costco sells only high-volume merchandise. In contrast, Walmart sells many high- and low-volume products. A typical supercenter has around 120,000 SKUs; a Costco warehouse only has about 3,700 SKUs⁠—narrowed to the most in-demand items. So everything Costco sells flies off the pallet, which generates stronger revenue per square foot.

Indeed, this is the key to Costco’s profitability: volume. All of its strategic decisions revolve around increasing volume. For example, Costco’s operating efficiency is lower than Walmart’s because its COGS over sales is worse than Walmart’s: 87.2% vs. 75.1%. (A higher expense ratio is worse.) But this suggests Costco is making a strategic choice. Costco scrupulously limits the markup on the goods it sells, such as its $4.99 whole roasted chicken. So its higher COGS over sales represents a lower retail price than Walmart, not a higher input cost. And its annual membership fee allows it to lower prices further. Costco’s low prices drive greater demand, which further pushes up volumes.

Now imagine that Costco wanted to sell a wider variety of products to be more convenient⁠—to be more of a one-stop shop like Walmart. What would happen to its performance? A large increase in SKUs would cause Costco’s profitability to plummet. The added SKUs would have lower volumes, hurting its capital efficiency. So Costco cannot copy Walmart. 

Instead, Costco increases its SKUs by selling seasonal products when they are in high demand. It sells camping equipment during the summer and hot chocolate mixes during the winter. This increases convenience while keeping capital efficiency high. 

This analysis shows that while Costco and Walmart both focus on low cost, they have fundamentally different strategies. Costco is singularly focused on sales volume, whereas Walmart focuses on convenience.

[^1]. Operating profit is sometimes adjusted before calculating NOPAT. For example, [impairments to long-lived intangible assets](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/what-are-differences-between-amortization-and-impairment.asp) (which are an operating expense) are normally excluded. 

[^2]. Here is an example: Firm A and Firm B both have an operating profit of $100 and a 20% tax rate. Firm A is financed with debt and pays $40 in interest. Firm B is financed with equity and pays no interest. Firm A’s taxable income is $100 − $40 = $60. Firm B’s taxable income is $100. Firm A’s operating profit less taxes is $100 − ($60 ⨉ 0.20) = $88. But Firm B’s is only $100 − ($100 ⨉ 0.20) = $80. 

[^3]. Sometimes the effective tax rate can be problematic. For example, airlines, which have a history of magnificent losses, can apply [net operating loss carryforwards](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/losscarryforward.asp), which may create negative effective tax rates and make NOPAT hard to interpret. In such cases, it is better to use operating profit (before taxes) or apply a historical average effective tax rate. Whatever adjustment is used should be applied to all benchmarks.

[^4]. Sometimes [``goodwill``](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goodwill.asp) is also subtracted from total assets. Whether to do so depends on how frequently a firm acquires other companies, the nature of the industry, and the purpose of the analysis. If goodwill is subtracted from total assets, it should be done for all firms included in the analysis.

[^5]. The formula is `\text{max}(0,\ \text{cash}_t − \text{sales}_t \times p)`, where `p` is a chosen percentage (e.g., 2%). Alternatively, excess cash can be considered any cash that’s not needed to cover a firm’s current liabilities less non-cash current assets. The alternative formula is `\text{min}(\text{cash}_t,\ \text{max}(0,\ \text{current assets}_t − \text{current liabilities}_t))`.

[^6]. Using the alternative method in footnote 5, Costco’s excess cash in 2025 was `\text{min}(\$14.2\text{bn},\ \text{max}(0,\ \$38.4\text{bn}−\$37.1\text{bn})) = \$1.3\text{bn}`.

[^7]. Many firms choose to lease rather than own the land and buildings they use. These leases are called right-of-use assets and appear separately from PPE on a balance sheet. They are considered PPE for profitability analysis and should be added to PPE when calculating IC. 

[^8]. In the case of debt, such as corporate bonds or bank loans, the cost of capital is the coupon or interest rate for the debt. In the case of equity, the cost of capital is the implied rate of return expected by shareholders. A firm’s cost of capital is normally based on its [weighted average cost of capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp).
