FIRMS REACH superior performance in different ways. Beneath those differences lie five recurring economic logics, which I call _strategic avenues_. Each leads to higher profits differently. Leaders who understand these avenues can craft better strategy. 

## Value composition
Customer value, price, cost, and sales define the composition of value⁠—how value is created and divided by a firm. A strategic avenue uniquely affects value composition, which is easily diagrammed.

A value composition diagram uses simple stacked bars to compare differences in value creation and capture.[^1] It is based on a firm’s demand and cost curves, as shown in Figure 1. Panel A recreates Figure 4 from [_Value Creation and Value Capture_](./value-creation-and-value-capture), which depicts a monopoly. The blue area represents consumer surplus captured by customers. The green area represents profit captured by the monopolist. And the red area represents value captured by others in the value chain, such as suppliers and employees. The value in Panel A is represented by the first stacked bar of panel B, before rivals enter the market. The height of the bar at `V` represents the average customer value per unit, or simply “unit value.” The height at `P` represents the average price of the product. And the height at `C` represents the average total cost per unit, or “unit cost.” The width of the bar represents the quantity demanded, or “unit sales.” `V − P` is the average consumer surplus per unit, and `P − C` is the firm’s average profit per unit, or “unit margin.” Like panel A, the blue, green, and red areas in panel B represent value captured by the customer, firm, and value chain, respectively. 

![Figure 1. Diagramming new rival entry](../img/value-composition.png#small)

Value composition diagrams compare two or more firms or compare the same firm at different times. The comparisons illustrate how strategies alter unit value, price, unit cost, or unit sales. In panel B, competition lowers demand for the monopolist’s product, which reduces unit sales (represented by the narrower width). Unit cost increases because the monopolist loses economies of scale. And the monopolist must lower its price. Combined, these shrink the monopolist’s profit. Note, however, that added rivalry does not lower value per unit. The firm creates the same value, but customers capture more of it.

Consider the value composition of selected U.S. airlines in Figure 2, panel A. Delta and American created similar value per ticket in 2024 (with Delta slightly higher) because of their similar class options (economy, first-class, etc.), airport lounges, and frequent flyer programs. Their ticket sales were also similar, depicted by their comparable widths. (The “ticket” I use here is standardized at 1,500 passenger miles, analogous to a flight from Washington D.C. to Denver, Colorado.) But Delta’s revenue per ticket (which includes the fare, baggage fees, and other revenues) was $400 while American’s was only $364⁠—a $36 difference. And Delta generated more profit per ticket: $24 versus American’s $8. Thus, Delta stronger profit came from higher pricing and greater efficiency. 

![Figure 2. U.S. airline industry](../img/carrier-value-composition.png#small)

Southwest created less value per ticket than Delta or American (depicted by its shorter height) because it focuses on economy class and has fewer frills. Frontier created even less unit value as a no-frills airline. Frontier was smaller than its rivals in 2024 based on ticket sales. Frontier’s revenue per ticket was only $185, which is much lower than the other three airlines. But its cost per ticket was also lower, so it scraped out a $4 profit per ticket. Frontier targets a different kind of flyer: a bargain hunter who will forgo perks for a cheaper flight.

Panel B shows that Delta’s value composition changed over time. Delta sold far fewer tickets in 2021 than 2018 as it dealt with the effects of the Covid pandemic, including the loss of business travelers. But ticket sales rebounded by 2024. The value per ticket increased in 2024 due to Delta’s investment in premium lounges, more comfortable seats, and free WiFi (as well as general inflation). Its profit per ticket recovered too, nearly matching 2018.

### Profit constraints
Raising prices, lowering unit costs, and growing unit sales are the three levers for increasing profits. But industry and organization constraints can make them hard to use. Prices and unit sales are constrained by customers’ willingness to pay and industry rivalry. And unit costs cannot be lowered unless amenable value chains and opportunities for efficiency exist. 

Each strategic avenue tackles these constraints differently⁠—either by easing them or by exploiting them more effectively.

## 1. Pricing avenue
Pricing can be implemented quickly. It requires no new products or markets and works within existing demand and cost constraints.

Firms regularly update their prices to maximize profit. Changes in customer preferences and competitors’ actions cause demand to fluctuate and shift, so firms must monitor customers’ willingness to pay to keep up. They do so by reviewing recent sales, benchmarking against competitors, and testing different prices in the market. For example, Procter & Gamble, maker of Tide, might set two prices for its detergent⁠—one a dollar higher than the other⁠—in a random sample of cities. By observing the prices’ effects on sales for several weeks, P&G can zero in on Tide’s demand curve. P&G’s smaller rivals may not use such A/B tests, choosing instead to follow P&G’s pricing leadership.

Pricing new products is challenging because historical sales (a key input for determining demand) are not available. For new products, firms analyze the sales of close substitutes and conduct focus groups or customer surveys. For example, to price a new iPhone (such as the iPhone Air [released in September 2025](https://www.wsj.com/tech/iphone-redesign-apple-event-118cc1a4)), Apple can examine the sales of its previous iPhone model, the incremental value of the new iPhone’s latest features, and the current prices of similar Samsung and Google phones.

In concentrated industries (such as oligopolies), firms may tacitly collude to raise prices. That is, a leading firm may raise its price and its rivals will copy its price movement. United was the first major airline to [introduce a baggage fee](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/04/27/the-man-behind-bag-fees/JHLvuMZhXLOgBZgGzWKCbJ/story.html) in 2008: $25 for a second checked bag. When flyers didn’t balk, all major airlines soon followed, except Southwest. Later that year, American introduced a $15 fee for the first checked bag and, again, all major airlines except Southwest quickly copied. 

But price hikes can quickly unwind too. When demand decelerates or declines, firms accrue excess capacity or inventory and are forced to lower their prices. Thus, tacit collusion is feasible in concentrated industries but is also unstable.

Instead of raising prices, firms may lower prices to undercut competitors and increase demand. But doing so is risky. Rivals can easily respond with their own price cuts, which may [escalate into a price war](https://hbr.org/2000/03/how-to-fight-a-price-war) that everyone loses. Normally a cost advantage is necessary to beat rivals on price, as explained in the efficiency avenue.

Alternatively, firms may use a [price discrimination](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-microeconomics/imperfect-competition/ap-price-discrimination-tutorial/v/first-degree-price-discrimination) strategy, charging different customer groups different prices based on their willingness to pay. Price discrimination is common. Airlines increase ticket prices as a flight date nears, knowing that late purchasers have pressing need to depart on the date. Going further, Delta started rolling out [individualized pricing in 2025](https://www.theverge.com/news/709556/delta-air-lines-ai-ticket-price-rollout), using AI to determine each customer’s willingness to pay. In other industries, manufacturers offer volume discounts to appease large buyers. Movie theaters charge adults a higher ticket price than children for the same movie. Streaming services have used price discrimination too. Disney released its live action remake of Mulan straight to Disney+, after Covid killed the movie’s planned theatrical release. But subscribers [had to pay a $30 “premier access” fee](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/30/media/mulan-disney-price/index.html) to watch it. Yet three months later, subscribers could stream it for free. Disney knew the movie’s biggest fans would pay more to watch early. 

Figure 3 depicts how price discrimination affects profit. Raising prices for customers who have a higher willingness to pay captures, as profit, value that otherwise would be consumer surplus. This increases unit margin.

![Figure 3. Pricing](../img/vcd-ave-1.png)

Price discrimination can also increase unit sales. This happens when firms offer a lower price to potential customers with a lower willingness to pay (such as a senior citizen discount at a restaurant) while holding price steady for existing customers.

Firms may not set prices to maximize profit for strategic reasons. This is common for venture-backed startups in new industries. They often price below their unit cost, burning through cash to grow quickly and create economies of scale. This strategy also builds customer awareness for new technologies. For example, ChatGPT released the first free-to-use large language model to the public in November 2022. Within five days it had over one million users and grew to over 800 million weekly users by the end of 2025. It also [burned through an estimated $9 billion](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-anthropic-profitability-e9f5bcd6) of cash that year. ChatGPT’s rivals were similarly unprofitable, but they continued to offer their AI models for free to make them an indispensable part of everyday life.

Startups will also strategically price below unit cost to capture first-mover advantages. This occurs in industries with [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect), which increase a product’s value for any given user as its customer base grows. Ebay, Facebook, LinkedIn, and YouTube all gained long-term competitive advantage from network effects.

As startups mature and venture funding ends, they begin pricing like traditional companies, seeking to maximize profits.

Overall, pricing strategies are limited. They create no new value, reduce no costs, and are easily copied. But they are easy to change. And when firms precisely estimate willingness to pay, pricing becomes a powerful tool for capturing surplus.

## 2. Value-creation avenue
While pricing works within existing constraints, value creation seeks to change them. Value creation increases customer value and differentiates products from their rivals. It focuses on strengthening brands, improving existing products, or developing new products. For example, during the first decade of the 21st century, [Burberry](http://us.burberry.com) fell behind rival luxury brands. The classic British maker of trench coats had lost its focus. But in 2006, its new CEO, [Angela Ahrendts](https://hbr.org/2013/01/burberrys-ceo-on-turning-an-aging-british-icon-into-a-global-luxury-brand), and her team began a turnaround, bringing new luster. They centralized and refocused design around Burberry’s iconic trench coat, targeted a new generation of millennials, and [brought the brand’s messaging into the digital age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krQG2Hceov4). Over the next eight years, the brand’s revenues tripled and profits doubled.

Nike, which has long dominated the athletic apparel and footwear industry, uses innovation, design, and marketing to create distinct brand value. It spends heavily on advertising and sponsorships (which it calls demand creation) to tell its story and connect with consumers. Nike’s long-running [“Just Do It” campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yO7xLAGugQ) broadcasts its brand ethos. Nike’s [Innovation Kitchen](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/nike-self-lacing-design-hyperadapt/) (its R&D hub) creates new technologies and designs, which includes the Vaporfly running shoe, worn by Nike athlete Eliud Kipchoge when he (unofficially) broke the two-hour marathon barrier. Some have even argued the Vaporfly [is too advantageous and should be banned](https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/nike-vaporfly-next-unfair-advantage-eliud-kipchoge-marathon-2-hour-record.html). 

[Square, Inc.](https://squareup.com/us/en) disrupted the merchant payment market through innovation. Early in the 21st century, street merchants and small vendors rarely accepted credit cards, but Square quickly changed that. In 2010, Jack Dorsey, cofounder of Twitter (now X), and Jim McKelvey developed a simple-to-use credit card reader and app that worked with mobile phones. Square grew rapidly after its launch, processing [over 2 billion card swipes in 2020](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000151267321000008/sq-20201231.htm) worth $104 billion. It became profitable in 2019.

When firms like Burberry, Nike, and Square innovate and strengthen their brands, they increase customers’ willingness to pay. This is depicted in panel A of Figure 4 by the increase in unit value. Firms also incur additional expenses, often in R&D and marketing, which increase unit cost. But as long as unit value increases more than unit cost, firms can grow their profit. They do so by increasing their price, potentially as much as the increase in unit value⁠—leaving consumer surplus unchanged. In this way, firms capture most of the newly created value.

![Figure 4. Value creation](../img/vcd-ave-2.png#small)

Panel B shows an alternate way to increase profit. Instead of raising their price, firms may let customers capture most of the newly created value. This will increase demand and expand unit sales. This strategy works well when demand is elastic and greater production creates economies of scale. The scale economies can offset the additional R&D and marketing costs from value creation, helping retain the original profit margin. 

Thus, value creation can increase profit by increasing unit margin (panel A) or increasing unit sales (panel B), or a combination of the two. 

Value-creation strategies are often praised, and rightly so⁠—but they carry risks. First, product development can lead to a type of R&D arms race with rivals. If rivals rapidly develop new product iterations, a firm may not have sufficient time to recoup its development costs for an existing product before the next version needs to enter the market. Second, product development includes demand uncertainty risks. Firms risk losing their initial investment if demand does not materialize. Third, if an innovative product is easy to copy, then market competition will let customers capture the newly created value. Thus, firms that pursue value creation must also consider whether they can construct barriers to imitation.

## 3. Efficiency avenue
Where value creation raises willingness to pay, efficiency attacks costs by pushing down the average cost curve. Firms commonly gain efficiencies through: 
- Process innovation.
- Fiscal discipline.
- Standardizing products and operations to drive scale.
- Leveraging supply chain partnerships to reduce input costs.

For example, Costco’s fiscal discipline keeps its overhead costs extremely low. This allows Costco to price lower than its competitors, which increase its volumes. Costco’s efficiencies are amplified by its warehouse model and narrow range of high-demand products, which further drive economies of scale. Because of its high volumes and fine-tuned supply chain, Costco sells its merchandise days before it pays the vendors who supplied the merchandise. This lowers its need for capital funding and makes it easier to expand. 

Other retailers are using automation to lower costs. [Amazon’s massive warehouse in Baltimore](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-robots-and-drones-will-change-retail-forever-1539604800) includes miles of conveyor belts with robots that do nearly everything, leaving only packing tasks to humans. In 2025, Amazon had nearly [as many robots as humans](https://www.wsj.com/tech/amazon-warehouse-robots-automation-942b814f) working in its warehouses. Both [Walmart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf-P-qNej3c) and [Target](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMwEzUgr4v4) are following suit to keep up. They are automating parts of their fulfillment centers and store operations to improve delivery and store pickup.

Strategic supply chain relationships often play a role in lowering costs. Tesla built its Gigafactory 1 in Nevada with its partner Panasonic, a Japanese electronics conglomerate. Both Tesla and Panasonic employ workers at the [4.9 million square-foot Gigafactory](https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/11/30/18118451/tesla-gigafactory-nevada-video-elon-musk-jobs-model-3). Panasonic manufactures battery cells that Tesla uses in its Model 3 sedans. Panasonic’s intellectual property and manufacturing prowess provide Tesla access to the latest in battery technology without needing to develop the technology in house. Because Panasonic is co-located inside the facility, Tesla can create more efficient manufacturing processes. The partnership is duplicated at the [Gigafactory 2 site in New York](https://electrek.co/2019/05/15/tesla-gigafactory-2-panasonic-solar-companies/). Panasonic produces solar cells that are used in Tesla’s solar panel business. While the partnership benefits both companies, it is not exclusive. Panasonic sells its solar cells to other solar manufacturers, and Tesla uses other partners for its [Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai, China](https://electrek.co/2019/11/27/panasonic-partner-tesla-gigafactory-3-battery-production/).

Efficiency strategies can lower fixed or variable costs, which increase profit in different ways, as shown in Figure 5. Panel A depicts firms that lower their fixed costs. This lowers unit cost but doesn’t require a change in price to maximize profit (see [_Value Creation and Value Capture_](./value-creation-and-value-capture)). Thus, the increase in profit is caused by improved unit margin, not unit sales. Panel B depicts firms that lower their variable costs. Lower variable costs allow firms to cut prices, attracting more price-conscious customers. This, in turn, increases unit sales, creates greater economies of scale, and maximizes profit. Thus, lowering variable costs increases unit margins and unit sales. 

![Figure 5. Efficiency](../img/vcd-ave-3.png#small)

Efficiency strategies are common, but firms must be careful not to destroy customer value when implementing them. The quest for lower costs can have unintended consequences on brand reputation or product quality, which can be tragic at times. For example, two Boeing 737 MAX planes crashed in Indonesia and Ethiopia, killing all 346 people aboard. A postmortem revealed that years of prioritizing cost and schedule impeded Boeing’s traditional emphasis on engineering excellence and safety. In this case, a system meant to stabilize the plane malfunctioned, causing the planes to crash soon after takeoff. 

## 4. Market-expansion avenue
Market expansion emphasizes volume over value or cost by prioritizing customer growth. Entering new geographic markets is a common way. For example, Tesla started exporting its Model S sedan to Europe in 2013, just one year after it was released in the United States. The next year it began exporting to China. Sales in Europe and China were strong enough that in 2019, Tesla started building Gigafactories in Berlin and Shanghai. The new plant in China allowed Tesla to price the Model 3 about $12 thousand cheaper than when it was imported from the United States. 

Other U.S. automakers expanded into China earlier than Tesla. [GM entered the Chinese market](https://www.chinabusinessreview.com/general-motors-races-ahead-in-the-china-market/) in 1994 through a joint venture, and China was GM’s largest market in unit sales for over a decade until 2023. Ford entered through a joint venture seven years after GM. The Chinese market attracted these firms because of its explosive growth. China’s GDP grew nearly 10% year over year for two decades after 1994. And Chinese consumers [spent $7.7 trillion in 2024](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/indicators), second only to the United States. But homegrown Chinese rivals like BYD have stolen market share from U.S. and European automakers in China, and they have expanded into Europe, South America, and other Asian countries.

Firms that expand internationally benefit from greater sales and potentially greater economies of scale, but global expansion has risks. Consumer preferences in foreign markets may differ from preferences in a firm’s home country. This lowers a product’s value unless it is customized to meet local tastes. But local customization raises a product’s cost and limits scale economies. Further, foreign firms often struggle to establish direct sales and distribution channels or find trusted distributors. International expansion also exposes a firm to currency translation risks, import duties, foreign regulatory regimes, and multiple taxing authorities. Yet, despite these challenges, the lure of sales growth makes foreign markets attractive.

Firms also reach new customers by adding distribution channels. Around 2014, mattress startups like [Purple Mattress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BvwpjaGZCQ) started advertising heavily online and delivering mattresses directly to consumers. Incumbent firms, which sold through traditional retailers, quickly took note. Tempur Sealy, the largest mattress manufacturer in the market, expanded into the direct-to-consumer channel in 2016, [selling its new bed-in-a-box online](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bed-in-a-box-startups-challenge-traditional-mattress-makers-1457380362). Meanwhile, Casper, the originator of the direct-to-consumer channel, [launched its first retail store in 2018](https://www.wsj.com/articles/casper-a-web-pioneer-to-open-200-stores-1533729600) in New York City with plans to expand across the United States. The need for both online and physical channels has swept across many industries, including apparel, home appliances, groceries, and fast food. 

To broaden their markets, firms may also seek out new uses for their existing products. For example, Michael Jordan and Nike launched the Air Jordan 1 basketball shoes in 1985. Designed originally to offer superior performance on the court, the shoe quickly became known for fashion off the court. Air Jordans catalyzed the [cult of the sneakerhead](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/how-sneakers-rose-to-catwalk-fashion/index.html) and created a following usually reserved for distinctive items like classic cars. Decades earlier, Converse had created its Chuck Taylor All Star basketball sneakers, and they went through a similar transition. Today All Stars are known for their connection to street fashion, not basketball.

In the pharmaceutical industry, firms “repurpose” their existing drugs, meaning they find new uses beyond the original intended use. For example, [gabapentin, which was originally developed for epilepsy](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161129150501.htm), is now commonly used as a pain reliever. And Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic was originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes but became wildly popular as a weight loss drug. As the popularity of GLP-1 drugs grew, Novo Nordisk launched Wegovy, a rebrand of Ozempic with different dosage, labeling, and an FDA approval specifically for weight loss.

Market expansion increases profit by increasing unit sales, as shown in Figure 6. Market expansion doesn’t require higher unit value or lower unit cost, though either may accompany it.

![Figure 6. Market expansion](../img/vcd-ave-4.png)

Seeking out new country markets, new distribution channels, and new uses for products raises the risk of new competition. Entry into a foreign country can provoke foreign incumbents, which may enter a firm’s home market in response. And entry into a partner’s channel can cause friction. When Nike began opening traditional retail stores beyond its NikeTowns and outlet stores, Foot Locker and other shoe retailers resisted, cancelling their Nike orders. This forced Nike to reassure retail partners that its limited move into retail was not meant to replace them. 

## 5. Rivalry-reduction avenue
Rivalry reduction is rooted in market power. It attempts to increase leverage over customers and suppliers and keep out new entrants. Reducing competition lets firms raise prices (which shrinks consumer surplus) and bargain down supply costs (which lowers the value captured by suppliers). Thus, rivalry reduction leads to increased profits through higher price and lower unit cost, as Figure 7 illustrates. It doesn’t necessarily change unit value or unit sales.

![Figure 7. Rivalry reduction](../img/vcd-ave-5.png)

Firms can limit competition and increase their power through acquisition. For example, the U.S. airline industry experienced a wave of consolidation during the Great Recession and over the next decade. Delta merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008. United merged with Continental two years later. The next year Southwest merged with AirTran, and American merged with US Airways the year after. In 2017, Alaska merged with Virgin America. Concentration in the U.S. domestic market for the top four firms⁠—American, Delta, Southwest, and United⁠—increased from 42% in 2006 to 64% in 2018, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. This lowered rivalry on some routes, making it easier to raise fares.

To deter new entrants, firms use limit pricing. An incumbent will temporarily lower its price to make it unprofitable for new entrants to enter or remain in the market. In the late 1990s, [American Airlines drastically lowered its fares](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB988402640807162964) for flights to and from Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport, its primary hub, in response to three smaller competitors entering the Dallas market. Lacking scale, the challengers couldn’t turn a profit while matching American’s low fares, so they exited the market. American then raised its fares once again. American’s use of limit pricing not only kicked the challengers out of Dallas but also threatened future potential entrants: stay out, or face a brutal price war.

Limiting competition may harm consumers, so federal and state regulators scrutinize these strategies. The Clinton administration sued American for its anti-competitive tactics in Dallas, claiming their pricing was predatory. (The administration lost its suit.) In 2019, the New York state attorney general and nine other state AGs, sued to [block the Sprint–T-Mobile merger](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/business/sprint-tmobile-merger.html). They argued that the merger would limit mobile access and increase prices. (The state AGs lost their suit.) 

Acquisitions are contentious because they may harm or help consumers. Acquisitions reduce rivalry, which may increase consumer prices, but they also increase efficiency, which may lower operating costs and lower prices. The spree of airline consolidation in the 2010s appears to have helped consumers: the average domestic fare fell from $415 in 2006 to $355 in 2018, adjusted for inflation.

Firms that reduce rivalry must be careful not to tarnish their reputations. For example, internet and cable TV providers like Comcast, Cox, and Charter hold outsized power in their local markets. They’re often criticized for high prices and poor service. Unsurprisingly, they rank among the companies with the worst reputations. 

## Choosing an avenue
Each strategic avenue uses a different economic rationale to increase profit:
1. The pricing avenue adjusts prices to influence unit margin and unit sales. 
2. The value-creation avenue increases customers’ willingness to pay, allowing firms to raise price and expand unit sales.
3. The efficiency avenue lowers costs, which increases unit margin and unit sales.
4. The market-expansion avenue increases unit sales.
5. The rivalry-reduction avenue limits competition so firms may increase price and lower unit cost.

Strategic avenues can be used together. Pricing is usefully paired with other avenues. And value creation and market expansion often go together, like when a firm introduces a new product (value creation) and new distribution channel (market expansion) together. Tempur Sealy did exactly this when it created a new bed-in-a-box sold online.

A firm’s mission and vision should guide their choice of a strategic avenue. For example, [Nike’s mission](https://about.nike.com/en/mission) is to “bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world,” with the footnote that, “if you have a body, you are an athlete.” Its mission drives its value creation focus. On the other hand, [Costco’s mission](https://customerservice.costco.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/829/~/what-is-costcos-mission-statement-and-code-of-ethics%3F) is “to continually provide our members with quality goods and services at the lowest possible prices.” Thus, Costco focuses on efficiency.

Industry lifecycle also affects which strategic avenues are important. In growth industries, value creation and market expansion are key, as exemplified by Tesla in its early years. In mature industries, pricing is paramount. When demand slows and declines, efficiency and rivalry reduction are critical. This occurs during an industry’s transition from growth to maturity (a “shakeout” period) and as an industry dies. For example, Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and many regional newspapers merged with GateHouse, a publisher of hundreds of community papers, in 2019. The combined company [slashed expenses](https://apnews.com/6507e82f647449bd817184b14174f477), laid off journalists and editors, centralized functions, and sold off buildings⁠—all to stay solvent in a declining industry. 

Strategists fail not for lack of ambition, but because they neglect the economics that govern performance. Understanding the strategic avenues⁠—and choosing among them deliberately⁠—can make the difference.
