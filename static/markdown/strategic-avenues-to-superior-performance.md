HOW CAN A FIRM achieve superior performance? The potential answers are almost endless. Yet they can be organized into five categories I call strategic avenues. Each avenue uses different economic logic to arrive at greater value capture and superior performance. By learning each avenue’s advantages and obstacles, you can determine which avenues are promising given your situation, and you can craft strategies that propel your firm forward.

To explain the strategic avenues, this article introduces value composition diagramming, a conceptual tool that illustrates the economic logic underlying each avenue. Value composition diagrams help you apply value creation and value capture concepts to strategic choices. They also help frame the choices available to firms and how those choices affect profitability and profit growth — two key indicators of superior performance. Value composition diagrams connect strategies to customer value, product prices, firm costs, and market demand. 

## Value composition diagrams
A value composition diagram takes information from a microeconomic plot and distills it into a simple bar diagram.[^1] Figure 1 shows how a value composition diagram relates to firm-specific demand and cost curves. The plot on the left recreates Figure 4 from [_Value Creation and Value Capture_](./value-creation-and-value-capture). The blue area under the demand curve represents consumer surplus captured by customers. The green area represents profit captured by the firm. And the red area represents value captured by other value chain entities, such as suppliers or employees. The value captured is also shown in the diagram on the right. The height of the bar at `V` represents the average customer value created per unit. The height at `P` represents the price of the product. And the height at `C` represents the average total cost per unit. The width of the bar represents the quantity demanded. `V − P` is the average consumer surplus per unit, and `P − C` is the firm’s profit per unit. The blue, green, and red areas within the bar represent value captured by the customer, firm, and value chain, respectively. 

Value composition diagrams illustrate how strategic decisions or changes in the industry can alter value, price, cost, or demand. The diagrams often compare two or more firms or compare the same firm at different times. In Figure 1 on the right, the two bars show the value creation and capture of a monopolist before and after rivals enter the market. Profit falls after rivals enter because competition drives down customers’ willingness to pay. Competition also lowers demand for the firm’s product, represented by the narrower width. The lower demand causes the firm to lose economies of scale, so the cost per unit increases as well. Overall, new entrants shrink the former monopolist’s profits. Note, however, that added rivalry does not lower customer value. The firm’s product offers the same value, but customers capture more of it because the firm lowers its price.

Figure 2 uses value composition diagrams to convey value creation and capture for three U.S. airlines in 2018. The price, cost per unit, and demand data were calculated using data from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The customer value per unit was estimated based on the airlines’ amenities and service quality. The top panel depicts the value composition for Spirit, Delta, and American Airlines. Delta and American had similar levels of customer value creation because of their similar class options (economy, economy plus, business, first-class), airport lounges, and frequent flyer programs. However, Spirit created less customer value as a no-frills airline, depicted by its shorter height. The similar width of Delta’s and American’s bars indicates that they flew about the same number of passenger-miles (a measure of an airline’s demand). The width of Spirit’s bar reveals that it was a much smaller airline. Delta and American also had very similar ticket prices, but American’s average cost was higher than Delta’s. This reveals that customers of Delta and American captured similar amounts of consumer surplus, but Delta captured more profit than American. And entities in American’s value chain captured more of the value created than those in Delta’s value chain. Additionally, Spirit’s costs were much lower than Delta’s, but Spirit’s ticket prices were much lower too. Thus, Spirit and Delta had similar profit per passenger-mile. 

The bottom panel depicts the change in value composition for Spirit Airlines over time. The increasing width of the bars indicates that Spirit’s number of passenger-miles grew over the six years. Spirit’s value to customers increased between 2015 and 2018 through its substantial improvement in on-time arrivals while its prices lowered. This increased Spirit’s consumer surplus, which fueled its growth. Spirit was able to lower its costs from 2012 to 2015, and then maintained its costs in 2018. Although Spirit’s profit per passenger-mile decreased in 2018, its growth in passenger miles kept its overall profit strong.

## Strategic avenues
Value composition diagrams show that firms can raise prices, lower costs, or increase demand (or all three) to increase profits. But price is constrained by customers’ willingness to pay and rivalry in the industry. Costs are constrained by the power of value chain entities and firm efficiency. And demand is constrained by the size of the market. Thus, firms need strategies to diminish these constraints or to work within them effectively. Each strategic avenue addresses one or more constraints on price, cost, or demand.

### First avenue: Pricing
Pricing strategies can be implemented quickly and work within the constraints on a firm. They do not require firms to target new customers, create new products, or expand into new markets. They do not attempt to raise customers’ willingness to pay or lower costs. Instead they attempt to maximize profit through price and quantity adjustments or through price discrimination, both of which are discussed below.

Firms can maximize their profit by adjusting their product price and production quantity. In Figure 3, the price-reduction panel illustrates that a firm is not taking full advantage of economies of scale. By lowering its price, the firm can increase demand and lower the average cost more than the price reduction.

To know when price reductions will result in greater profit, firms must analyze customers’ willingness to pay and estimate a demand curve. This is one of the important tasks of the marketing function. If a product has close rival offerings or a long history in the market, then a firm may use existing market intelligence to estimate the demand curve. This can include analysis of market trend reports, the firm’s sales history, and competitor analysis. However, if a product is new to the market, then firms may analyze sales of the closest substitute products and conduct primary research such as focus groups and consumer surveys. 

For example, each time Apple releases a new iPhone, such as the iPhone 13 ([released in September 2021](https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-13-pro-max-mini-review-11632223198)), it must evaluate the demand for the new model at potential price points. Apple must consider the amount of consumer value created by the new features, the current pricing and features of competing phones from Samsung, HTC, and Huawei, and trends in consumer purchasing behavior in various countries.

Once a firm has estimated a product’s demand curve and the average total cost (ATC) curve, it is relatively straightforward to determine a price and production quantity that maximizes profit. A firm can maximize profit at the point where the [marginal cost curve intersects with the marginal revenue curve](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-microeconomics/production-cost-and-the-perfect-competition-model-temporary/short-run-production-costs/v/marginal-revenue-and-marginal-cost). This, of course, assumes that the estimates of the demand and ATC curves are accurate.

However, there may be competitive reasons why firms price their products so they don’t maximize profits. For example, firms may set prices low to rapidly accumulate customers because [network effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) play a role in their markets. In this way, a firm might sacrifice short term profits for longer term gains. 

Additionally, firms can increase profits by adopting a price discrimination strategy. [Price discrimination](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/ap-microeconomics/imperfect-competition/ap-price-discrimination-tutorial/v/first-degree-price-discrimination) denotes charging different customers higher or lower prices for the same product because some are willing to pay more or less. In Figure 3, the price discrimination panel illustrates that firms can capture more value that otherwise would be consumer surplus.

Price discrimination is a common strategy in a variety of industries. When a firm offers volume discounts to customers, it’s using price discrimination. Airlines use it to adjust ticket prices as departure dates near. People who buy tickets within a week of departure are willing to pay more than those who buy tickets six weeks before a flight. Airlines understand this and price accordingly. Movie theaters use price discrimination when they sell tickets to adults at a higher price than to children even though they are watching the same movie. Disney chose to discriminate on price with its release of Mulan in 2020. After COVID-19 killed the movie’s planned theatrical release, Disney released Mulan in September on its Disney+ streaming service. But subscribers [had to pay a $30 “premier access” fee](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/30/media/mulan-disney-price/index.html) to watch it. Yet three months later, subscribers could stream it for free. Disney knew it could get the movie’s biggest fans to pay more to watch it earlier.

Pricing strategies depend on a rich understanding of customers, their attitudes and attributes, and their willingness to pay. Pricing can be changed quickly and immediately affect profits. As industry conditions evolve, firms can quickly adjust their pricing to maintain maximal profits. However, once prices have been optimally set, there is little more that pricing strategies can do. They do not create customer value or shift demand or cost curves. Further, pricing strategies can easily be copied by rivals, which reduces their ability to spur new demand and can lead to [price wars](https://hbr.org/2000/03/how-to-fight-a-price-war). Nonetheless, pricing strategies can have a substantial effect on profits and can be paired with strategies from other avenues.

### Second avenue: Value creation
To increase customer value and differentiate a product from its rivals, firms use value creation strategies. The goal is to increase product differentiation so that the value created can be captured by the firm that created it. Product differentiation allows a firm to increase prices or to increase demand by passing the value created on to customers. Creating value normally increases a firm’s costs. But a firm can attempt to recoup the costs through price increases or to negate the costs through economies of scale. Figure 4 illustrates both scenarios. In the left panel, the firm’s unit cost increases when it creates new value. But it is able to increase profits by increasing the price and capturing most of the new value created. In the right panel, the firm creates new value but does not raise its price. This leads to greater demand (illustrated by the wider bar), which allows the firm to gain economies of scale and lower cost. In both scenarios, the demand curve shifts upward, and the question of whether to increase price or to create greater demand depends on which alternative best maximizes profit. 

Firms with value creation strategies often strengthen their brands, improve their existing products, or develop entirely new products. For example, during the first decade of the 21st century, [Burberry](http://us.burberry.com) was falling behind the growth of other luxury brands. The classic British maker of trench coats had lost its focus and brand cachet. Beginning in 2006, its new CEO,[ Angela Ahrendts](https://hbr.org/2013/01/burberrys-ceo-on-turning-an-aging-british-icon-into-a-global-luxury-brand), and her team brought new luster to the troubled brand. They centralized and refocused design around its iconic trench coat, targeted a new generation of millennials, and [brought the brand’s messaging into the digital age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krQG2Hceov4). Over the next eight years, the brand’s revenues tripled and profits doubled. 

Nike, one of the most recognized and [valuable brands in the world](https://www.interbrand.com/best-brands/best-global-brands/2019/ranking/), focuses on marketing, design, and innovation to create customer value. It spends heavily on advertising and sponsorships (which it calls demand creation) to tell its story and connect with consumers. Nike’s “Just Do It” campaign [has spanned decades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yO7xLAGugQ) and captures the central theme in its consumer messaging. Nike’s [Innovation Kitchen](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/nike-self-lacing-design-hyperadapt/) is the central hub of its R&D and design activities. Its Vaporfly running shoes were worn by Nike-sponsored runner Eliud Kipchoge to (unofficially) break the two-hour marathon barrier in 2019. Some thought the shoes were so advantageous, they [argued the shoes should be banned](https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/nike-vaporfly-next-unfair-advantage-eliud-kipchoge-marathon-2-hour-record.html). Nike has long dominated the $100+ athletic shoe market segment through a consistent focus on its brand messaging and product innovation.

[Square, Inc.](https://squareup.com/us/en) rapidly created customer value and disrupted the small-merchant financial services industry through its innovations. Before Square, it was difficult for street merchants and small vendors to accept credit cards, but Square quickly changed that. In 2010 Jack Dorsey, cofounder of Twitter, and his friend Jim McKelvey developed simple-to-use credit card readers and an app that worked with mobile phones.  Square grew rapidly and processed [over 2 billion card swipes in 2020](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000151267321000008/sq-20201231.htm) worth $104 billion. Its operations became profitable in 2019.

Firms with great value-creation strategies are often praised, and rightly so. However, there are risks and costs associated with them. First, product development can lead to a type of R&D arms race with rivals. If rivals rapidly develop new product iterations, a firm may not have sufficient time to recoup product development costs for an existing version before the next version needs to enter the market. Second, product development includes risks because demand for the new product is uncertain. Firms risk losing their initial investment if demand does not materialize. Third, if a firm creates value but its product is undifferentiated or easy to imitate, then market competition will let customers capture the created value. Thus, value creation must also drive product differentiation.

### Third avenue: Efficiency
Efficiency strategies can wring out costs in the value chain and push down the average cost curve. They can also lower fixed costs and allow firms to increase their per unit profits. And efficiency strategies can lower variable costs and allow firms to lower their price, increase demand, and gain economies of scale. (See [_Value Creation and Value Capture_](./value-creation-and-value-capture) for details.) Efficiency strategies let firms reach more price-conscious consumers. Figure 5 illustrates how a firm increases profits using efficiency strategies. In the left panel, the firm lowers its fixed costs, which lowers the average total cost per unit. Assuming the firm already optimized its production, the optimal production does not change. Thus, the increase in profit is caused by the per-unit profit increase. In the right panel, the firm lowers its variable costs and maximizes profits by lowering its price, which increases demand and creates greater economies of scale. The lower price also attracts price-conscious customers and increases the value created by the firm.

Firms can gain efficiencies through: 
- Process innovation
- Fiscal discipline
- Standardizing products and operations to drive scale
- Leveraging supply chain partnerships to reduce input costs

For example, [Costco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco) opened its first store in 1983 in Seattle and is now one of the largest retailers in the world. Its fiscal discipline keeps its overhead costs extremely low. This allows Costco to price its products lower than its competitors and increase its volumes. These efficiencies are complemented by its warehouse model and its narrow range of high-demand products, which further provide economies of scale. Because of Costco’s high volumes and fine-tuned supply chain, it often sells products to consumers many days before it pays suppliers for them. This lowers its need to raise capital to fund its operations and makes it easier to expand. 

Other retailers such as Amazon and Kroger use innovative processes to automate their warehouses. [Amazon’s massive warehouse in Baltimore](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-robots-and-drones-will-change-retail-forever-1539604800) includes miles of conveyor belts with robots that do nearly everything, leaving only packing tasks to humans. [Kroger partnered with Ocado](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-07-22/kroger-goes-full-robot-to-take-on-amazon-with-ocado), a U.K.-based technology company, to build fully automated distribution centers in the United States. Ocado places robots on an elevated grid to pick grocery items and place them into bins below the grid. The system is powered by AI that optimizes receiving, warehousing, picking, and packing. The aim is to lower the fulfillment costs of online grocery orders. In some U.S. locations, Ocado has been able to reduce Kroger’s cost of online grocery retail to match its physical retail.

Strategic supply chain relationships like the Kroger-Ocado partnership often play a role in lowering costs. Tesla built its Gigafactory 1 in Nevada with its partner Panasonic, a Japanese electronics conglomerate. Both Tesla and Panasonic employ workers at the [4.9 million square-foot Gigafactory](https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/11/30/18118451/tesla-gigafactory-nevada-video-elon-musk-jobs-model-3). Panasonic manufactures battery cells that Tesla uses in its Model 3 sedans. Panasonic’s intellectual property and manufacturing prowess provide Tesla access to the latest in battery technology without needing to develop the technology in house. Because Panasonic is co-located inside the facility, Tesla can create more efficient manufacturing processes. The partnership is duplicated at the [Gigafactory 2 site in New York](https://electrek.co/2019/05/15/tesla-gigafactory-2-panasonic-solar-companies/). Panasonic produces solar cells that are used in Tesla’s solar panel business (formerly Solar City). While the partnership benefits both companies, it is not exclusive. Panasonic sells its solar cells to other solar manufacturers, and Tesla will use other partners for its [Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai, China](https://electrek.co/2019/11/27/panasonic-partner-tesla-gigafactory-3-battery-production/).

Efficiency strategies require firms to differentiate themselves similar to value creation strategies. But instead of creating differentiation from the customer’s perspective, efficiency strategies rely on differentiating its operations and value chain relationships. When a firm can lower its costs below its rivals’ costs, the firm can earn greater profit per unit and attract more customers with its uniquely lower prices, as shown in Figure 5 above. However, if rivals can easily copy a firm’s efficiency gains, then competition in the industry will drive prices downward and wipe out any profit gains.

Further, firms must take care not to destroy customer value when seeking efficiency gains. The quest for lower costs can have unintended consequences on product quality, which can erode value and customer willingness to pay.

### Fourth avenue: Market expansion
To increase profits by growing the number of customers, firms use market expansion strategies. Market expansion allows firms to increase production and potentially take advantage of greater economies of scale. This avenue does not require firms to increase customer value or seek efficiency gains, though either may occur alongside market expansion. Figure 6 shows how profits grow when increased demand spurs increased production, which leads to economies of scale. However, expansion strategies can spawn new costs that limit scale economies.

International expansion is a common way for firms to reach new customers. Tesla began delivering its mainstream all-electric sedan, the Model S, to European customers in 2013, just one year after it began deliveries in the United States. The following year, Tesla began exporting to China as well. Sales in China were strong enough that by 2019, [Tesla broke ground for a manufacturing plant in Shanghai](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-china-factorynow-a-field-soon-a-plantaims-to-pump-out-its-first-tesla-this-year-11546865615?mod=article_inline) to build the smaller Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. The new plant allowed Tesla to price the Model 3 about $12,000 cheaper than when it was imported from the United States. Other U.S. auto manufacturers expanded into China earlier than Tesla. [GM entered the Chinese market](https://www.chinabusinessreview.com/general-motors-races-ahead-in-the-china-market/) in 1994 through a joint venture, and China is now GM’s largest market in unit sales. Ford entered through a joint venture seven years after GM. The Chinese market is attractive to these firms because of its explosive growth. China’s GDP grew nearly 10% year over year for two decades after 1994. And Chinese households [spent $5.6 trillion in 2019](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/indicators), second only to the United States (at $14.4 trillion).

Firms that expand internationally benefit from greater sales and potentially greater economies of scale, but global growth has many risks. Consumer preferences in foreign markets may differ from preferences in a firm’s home country. This can lower a product’s value unless it is customized to meet local tastes. But local customization raises a product’s cost and limits the opportunity for scale economies. Further, it is often challenging to establish direct sales and distribution channels or find trusted distributors in foreign markets. International expansion also exposes a firm to currency translation risks, import duties, foreign regulatory regimes, and multiple taxing authorities. Yet, despite these challenges, firms are attracted to foreign markets because of their great potential to spur profit growth.

Another way firms reach new customers is by adding or expanding distribution channels. Starting around 2014, mattress startups like [Purple Mattress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BvwpjaGZCQ) began advertising heavily online and delivering mattresses directly to consumers. Incumbent firms observed their success and learned that the direct-to-consumer channel, previously unused in this industry, was now viable. In 2016, Tempur Sealy, the largest mattress manufacturer in the market, started [selling its own bed-in-a-box online](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bed-in-a-box-startups-challenge-traditional-mattress-makers-1457380362?mod=article_inline). Meanwhile, Casper, the originator of the direct-to-consumer channel, [launched its first retail store in 2018](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bed-in-a-box-startups-challenge-traditional-mattress-makers-1457380362?mod=article_inline) in New York City with plans to expand across the United States. The newfound need to deliver products through online and physical channels has swept across many industries such as apparel, footwear, office supplies, home appliances, groceries, and fast food. 

To broaden their markets, firms may also seek out new uses for their existing products. For example, Michael Jordan and Nike launched the Air Jordan 1 basketball shoes in 1985. Designed originally to offer superior performance on the court, the shoe quickly became known for fashion off the court. Air Jordans catalyzed the [cult of the sneakerhead](https://www.cnn.com/style/article/how-sneakers-rose-to-catwalk-fashion/index.html) and created a following usually reserved for distinctive items like classic cars. Decades earlier, Converse had created its Chuck Taylor All Star basketball sneakers, and they went through a similar expansion. Today All Star’s are known for their connection to street fashion and have lost nearly all of their connection to basketball. (Converse is a subsidiary of Nike, Inc.) In the pharmaceutical industry, firms often “repurpose” their existing drugs, meaning they find new uses for which their drugs were not originally developed. For example, [gabapentin, which was originally developed for epilepsy](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161129150501.htm), is now commonly used as a pain reliever. Because of the large profit potential, firms mine pharmaceutical databases to find new opportunities for old drugs.

Seeking out new country markets, new distribution channels, and new uses for products comes with the risk of new competition. For example, entry into a foreign country can prompt a competitive reaction from foreign incumbents; they may enter a firm’s home market in response. And entry into a partner’s space can cause friction. When Nike began opening traditional retail stores beyond its NikeTown and outlet stores, Foot Locker and other retailers balked and cancelled orders. Nike had to smooth its relationships with its retail partners and assure them its limited move into physical retail was not meant to replace them. 

### Fifth avenue: Rivalry reduction
To reduce competition in the industry and keep out new entrants, firms can engage in rivalry reduction strategies. Reducing competition rarely creates customer value. Instead, it allows firms to raise product prices (which shrinks consumer surplus) and to bargain down supply costs (which lowers the value captured by suppliers). Figure 7 illustrates that rivalry reduction strategies are intended to shift value capture in a way that increases a firm’s profits. Such strategies don’t necessarily change customer value or demand.

Firms can increase their power and limit competition through acquisitions, which increases firm concentration in an industry. For example, the U.S. airline industry experienced a wave of consolidation over a 10-year period starting about the time of the Great Recession. In 2008, Delta merged with Northwest Airlines, in 2010 United merged with Continental, in 2011 Southwest merged with AirTran, in 2012 American merged with US Airways, and in 2017 Alaska merged with Virgin America. Concentration in the U.S. domestic market for the top four firms — American, Southwest, Delta, and United — increased from 49% in 2006 to 77% in 2018, according to data available from the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Data_Elements_Financial.aspx?Data=7).

When an industry becomes sufficiently concentrated, firms may be able to raise prices through tacit collusion. Normally tacit collusion occurs when a leading firm raises its price and other firms copy its price movement. United Airlines was the first major airline to [introduce a baggage fee](https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/04/27/the-man-behind-bag-fees/JHLvuMZhXLOgBZgGzWKCbJ/story.html) in 2008: $25 for a second checked bag. All major airlines except Southwest soon copied it. Later that year, American introduced a $15 fee for the first checked bag and, again, all major airlines except Southwest quickly followed. Baggage fees have slowly inched upward since that time. 

Tacit collusion is more viable when demand is strong within an industry. However, when demand decelerates or declines, firms often find themselves with excess capacity, and they begin to lower their prices. Once price declines begin, price hikes due to tacit collusion can quickly unravel.

To deter new entrants, firms may also engage in limit pricing. Limit pricing occurs when an incumbent prices its product below the profit-maximizing price to make it unprofitable for new entrants to enter or remain in the market. For example, in the late 1990s, [American Airlines drastically lowered its fares](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB988402640807162964) for flights to and from Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport, its primary hub, when three new smaller competitors entered the Dallas market. Lacking American’s size, the challengers could not turn a profit with reduced fares, and they exited the market. American was then free to raise its fares once again. In addition, American’s use of limit pricing signaled to future potential entrants to stay out of Dallas or face a brutal price war.

Because firms’ attempts to limit competition may harm consumers, federal and state regulators rely on antitrust law to deter such strategies. For example, the Clinton administration sued American Airlines for its anti-competitive tactics in Dallas, claiming their pricing was predatory. (The administration lost its suit.) And in 2019 the New York state attorney general, joined by many other state AGs, sued to [block the Sprint–T-Mobile merger](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/business/sprint-tmobile-merger.html). They argued that the merger would limit access and increase prices for consumers. (The state attorneys general lost their suit.) Antitrust lawsuits are often contentious because it’s difficult to determine if a firm’s strategies to reduce competition will harm consumers. Strategies that limit competition may often increase efficiency as well. In the case of industry consolidation, firms not only gain market power, which can potentially increase prices, they also create economies of scale, which can lead to lower operating costs and lower prices. For example, even though the U.S. airline industry consolidated greatly during the 2010s, the average price of a domestic ticket fell from $415 in 2006 to $355 in 2018, adjusted for inflation.

Finally, firms that enact rivalry reduction strategies may tarnish their own reputations.  For example, internet and TV providers like Comcast, Charter, and Dish hold outsized power in their local markets such that they can charge high prices for poor service. Unsurprisingly, they are among the [companies with the worst reputations](https://digg.com/2019/companies-best-worst-reputations). 

## Choosing strategies
Each strategic avenue uses a different economic logic to raise prices, lower costs, or expand production — or some combination of the three:
1. Pricing strategies adjust prices and production quantities to maximize profit. 
2. Value creation strategies increase customer value so firms may raise prices or increase production.
3. Efficiency strategies lower costs and increase demand.
4. Market expansion strategies increase demand and may lead to economies of scale.
5. Rivalry reduction strategies limit rivalry so firms may increase prices and bargain down costs.

Firms can adopt strategies from one or more of the avenues simultaneously. For example, a firm may introduce a new product (value creation) and choose a new distribution strategy (market expansion) at the same time. This is exactly what Tempur Sealy did when it started online sales of its new bed-in-a-box to compete with Purple and Casper. However, combining too many strategies from too many avenues can be tricky for managers and lead to failure or other unintended consequences. Normally firms will choose only one or two avenues at a time. 

Firms can use their mission and vision to guide their choice of a strategic avenue. For example, [Nike’s mission](https://about.nike.com/) is to “bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world,” with the side note that “if you have a body, you are an athlete.” Its mission drives it to pursue value creation strategies. On the other hand, [Costco’s mission](https://customerservice.costco.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/829/~/what-is-costcos-mission-statement-and-code-of-ethics%3F) is “to continually provide our members with quality goods and services at the lowest possible prices.” Thus, Costco tends to choose efficiency strategies.

Firms may also choose strategic avenues based on the industry environment. For example, firms in growth industries will generally choose value creation strategies matched with market expansion strategies, such as Tesla did in the electric vehicle industry. Firms in stable, mature industries frequently tweak their pricing strategies as is often seen in the airline industry. And firms in an industry with declining demand will often choose efficiency and rivalry reduction strategies. For example, in 2019 Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and many regional newspapers merged with GateHouse, a publisher of hundreds of community papers. The combined company [slashed expenses](https://apnews.com/6507e82f647449bd817184b14174f477), laid off journalists and editors, centralized functions, and sold off buildings. 

The strategy examples in each avenue above illustrate only the most common ones. There are many more strategies that can be used, depending on a firm’s industry and positioning. But the important thing to remember is this: If a strategy is to lead to superior performance, it must maximize profit through price adjustments, create new value, increase efficiency, expand the market, or reduce competition. If it does not clearly pursue one of these avenues, then the strategy is suspect. Thus, when creating new strategies for your firm, it is important to know which avenue you are using.
