BetterHelp offers a monthly subscription for online counseling and therapy. Cofounders Alon Matas and Danny Bragonier launched the company in 2013 as mental health challenges for teens and young adults rose. 

While the sessions are traditional — BetterHelp partners with licensed psychologists, therapists and counselors — everything else about its business was innovative when it launched, diverging from traditional sole-proprietor, local menthal health practices. Yet Teledoc Health, BetterHelp's parent company, had yet to turn a profit in 2024 or any year prior. 

Is BetterHelp's business model the future of therapy or is it unsustainable? Will BetterHelp ultimately turn profitable, or is it doomed to fail?
